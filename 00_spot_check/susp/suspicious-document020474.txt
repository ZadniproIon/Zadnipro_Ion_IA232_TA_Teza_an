Abstract

Electron-doped T’-type cuprate crystals necessitate both Ce substitution and reduction annealing for the genesis of superconductivity; however, reduction annealing alone can induce superconductivity in T’-type cuprate thin films. To investigate the low-energy electronic states contributing to superconductivity, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements were performed on superconducting Pr\(_2\) CuO\(_4\) thin films, which are devoid of Ce. The results suggest that the overall band structure and Fermi surface area of superconducting Pr\(_2\) CuO\(_4\) resemble those of superconducting Ce-doped bulk crystals, implying that the actual electron concentration, rather than the Ce concentration, is significant when discussing the physical properties of T’-type cuprates.


High-temperature superconductivity in the cuprate family emerges when carriers are introduced into an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott-insulating parent compound through chemical substitutions. For the electron-doped cuprates $Ln_{2-x}$ Ce \textsubscript{x} CuO \textsubscript{4} ($Ln$: rare earth), which exhibit the so-called T'-type structure with Cu atoms coordinated by four O atoms in a square-planar configuration, carriers are introduced through the substitution of Ce\textsuperscript{4+} for $Ln^{3+}$. Recent research has sparked debate due to the realization of superconductivity in thin-film samples without Ce substitution (1), challenging the conventional view that parent cuprates are Mott insulators. A critical step for achieving superconductivity is post-growth reduction annealing, thought to eliminate a small number of impurity oxygen atoms at the apical sites (4), acting as strong scattering centers (6). Due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of thin films compared to bulk, apical oxygen atoms are expected to diffuse more efficiently toward the surface in thin films, potentially leading to superconductivity emergence in thin films without Ce substitution (7). On the theoretical side, studies employing the local density approximation plus dynamical mean-field theory have characterized the parent compounds of the T'-type cuprates as weakly correlated Slater insulators or metals instead of Mott insulators (8).


The primary effects of annealing on the physical properties of T'-type cuprates include a decrease in the quasi-particle scattering rate and a reduction in both the antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation length and the AFM order's Néel temperature, which competes with superconductivity. This reduction is likely due to the removal of apical oxygen atoms. Additionally, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies on Ce-doped bulk single crystals and Ce-free insulating thin films have shown that annealing also results in electron-doping. The electron concentration increases with annealing, which suggests that oxygen atoms may also be removed from regular sites (the O sites in the CuO2 planes and/or the Ln2 O2 layers) during the annealing process. It has been pointed out by infrared and Raman spectroscopy studies on bulk crystals and thin films that annealing could create oxygen vacancies at these regular sites. If the electron concentration is not solely determined by the Ce concentration but also by oxygen vacancies, the band filling of the superconducting (SC) Ce-free T'-type cuprates should be directly determined. Horio et al. have recently reported hard x-ray photoemission and soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on SC Ce-free T'-type Nd2 CuO4 thin films. By inducing superconductivity in Nd2 CuO4 thin films through annealing, the chemical potential was shifted to the same level as that of 15-19% Ce-doped SC films, suggesting a significant amount of electron doping through annealing. Although core-level spectroscopies provide precise, element-specific electronic structure information, they do not offer momentum-resolved, low-energy information like ARPES. ARPES measurements, which are essential for establishing the phase diagram, are highly surface-sensitive and have not been applicable to reduction-annealed thin films because the film surfaces become contaminated once they are removed from a growth chamber for post-growth, ex-situ annealing.


Recently, Krockenberger et al . (25) successfully grew SC thin films of Ce-free T’-type cuprate Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} without post-growth annealing. Those films were grown on a perfectly lattice-matched substrate under relatively stronger reducing condition on the verge of phase decomposition. Note that the “relatively stronger reducing condition” means higher temperature and lower ozone pressure than in a typical growth, and does not mean the usage of reducing agents such as CaH \textsubscript{2} . The grown films were capped with a Se protective layer to prevent surface contamination during the transfer to the ARPES apparatus in air. The Se layer was successfully removed in vacuo prior to the ARPES measurements, as we shall describe below in detail. In this Letter, we report the ARPES studies on thus prepared thin films of SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} to reveal the low-energy electronic structure relevant to the superconductivity. We have measured both SC and non-SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin films grown under different reducing conditions, and determined their carrier concentrations quantitatively from the area of the observed Fermi surface. The results indicate that the band filling of SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} is larger than half-filling and is comparable to that of SC Ce-doped bulk single crystals.

Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin films for the ARPES measurements were synthesized at NTT Basic Research Laboratories using the molecular beam epitaxy method on GdScO \textsubscript{3} (110) substrates. By varying the growth condition as described elsewhere (25) , two Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} films were grown: one was non-SC with the $c$ -axis length of 12.207 Å  and the other was SC with the $c$ -axis length of 12.190 Å. The SC film exhibited $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 25.5 K after the ARPES measurement as shown in Fig. 1 . The SC film grown under a stronger reducing condition has a shorter $c$ -axis length than the non-SC film, suggesting that less apical oxygen atoms are incorporated. ARPES measurements were carried out at beamline 2A of Photon Factory using circularly polarized $h\nu=55$ eV photons. The total energy resolution was set at 35 meV. Just prior to the ARPES measurements, x-ray photoemission measurements were also performed on the same sample surfaces without moving the sample position to check the surface condition with linearly polarized $h\nu=1200$ eV photons. All the measurements were performed at 15 K under a vacuum better than $7\times 10^{-11}$ Torr.

To preserve the cleanliness of Pr\(_2\) CuO\(_4\) thin films prior to ARPES measurements, a Se capping method was employed during growth. The films were subsequently cooled down to 70\(^{\circ}\)C and Se was deposited onto the film surfaces to a thickness of approximately 50 nm under a vacuum of \(\sim\) 1\(\times\) 10\(^{-9}\) Torr to prevent contamination before being removed from the growth chamber. The films were then transferred from NTT Basic Research Laboratories to Photon Factory, heated at 150\(^{\circ}\)C for 30 minutes within a vacuum better than 2\(\times\) 10\(^{-9}\) Torr to desorb the Se cap, and transferred to the measurement chamber in vacuo. The effectiveness of the Se-capping method for Pr\(_2\) CuO\(_4\) is not certain, as it is typically used for thin films containing Se such as Bi\(_2\) Se\(_3\) and FeSe.

To verify the surface condition, core-level photoemission spectra were measured using soft x-rays. Figure 2(a) shows the x-ray photoemission spectra over a wide energy range before and after the desorption of Se. Before desorption, the spectrum was dominated by Se core-level peaks; however, after heating, peaks for Pr, Cu, and O emerged. The intense Se 3\(d\) peaks became indiscernible after heating [Fig. 2(b)], suggesting that the desorption of amorphous Se was nearly complete. The emerging O 1\(s\) core level had a sharp peak and a long tail on the higher binding energy side. The intensity of the shoulder at \(\sim\) 531 eV was comparable to that of Nd\(_2\)-x Ce\(_x\) CuO\(_4\) bulk single crystals cleaved in-situ in a previous soft x-ray photoemission study. Thus, it appears that the Se cap effectively protected the Pr\(_2\) CuO\(_4\) surface from contamination. It is possible that the Se-capping method may also be applicable to other oxides, thereby extending the applicability of ARPES to oxide thin films.


Upon verifying the film's surface condition, we initiated ARPES measurements using VUV photons. Fig. 3 depicts the successful observation of Fermi surfaces and band dispersion for both superconducting (SC) and non-superconducting Pr\textsubscript{2}CuO\textsubscript{4} thin films. In the non-SC film, as we transitioned from the nodal region [Fig. 3 (b1)] to the hot spot [Fig. 3 (b2)], where the Fermi surface intersects the AFM Brillouin-zone boundary, a band gap emerged, indicative of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) pseudogap characteristic of electron-doped cuprates. As we approached the antinode, the upper portion of the split band dipped below the Fermi level [Fig. 3 (b3)], generating significant spectral intensity in that region. The resulting Fermi surface [Fig. 3 (a)] exhibited discontinuity, with the antinodal segment displaying the clearest discontinuity, while the nodal segment was barely discernible. In contrast, for the SC sample, spectral intensity at the hot spot remained present [Fig. 3 (d2)] and the Fermi surface remained connected [Fig. 3 (c)], suggesting a strong suppression of the AFM pseudogap. This suppression is detailed in the Supplemental Material (33), which includes references (34). Remarkably, robust antiferromagnetism in the parent T’-type cuprates is suppressed without Ce substitution but only through oxygen reduction.


To calculate the electron concentration of Pr2CuO4 thin films, the constant-energy surfaces at 150 meV below the Fermi level were derived from the peak positions of momentum distribution curves at E = EF - 150 meV (See Supplemental Material 33 for the original images of the constant-energy surfaces). These surfaces are depicted in Fig. 4 (a). Unlike the Fermi surface, which is truncated by the AFM order in non-superconducting (SC) films (as shown in Fig. 3 (a)), the high-binding-energy constant-energy surface in Fig. 4 (a) remains connected and is less affected by the AFM order. However, Richard et al. (21) showed that the constant-energy surface of Pr2-x Cex CuO4 bulk single crystals at E = EF - 100 meV is identical for both as-grown and annealed samples, indicating that the electron concentration of bulk single crystals is not affected by moderate annealing. In contrast, the hole-like surface centered at (π, π) is smaller for the SC film in the present Pr2CuO4 thin films, suggesting that the electron concentration is higher in the SC film synthesized under stronger reducing conditions.


Figure 4(b) depicts the Fermi surfaces for both superconducting (SC) and non-superconducting (non-SC) Pr\(_2\)CuO\(_4\) thin films. For the SC sample, the Fermi wavevector (\(k_{\text{F}}\)) was determined from the peaks in the momentum distribution curves (MDCs) at the Fermi energy (\(E_{\text{F}}\)). For the non-SC sample, the same method was applied, except around the node and hot spot, where MDC-peak positions from \(E-E_{\text{F}} = -70\) meV to \(-20\) meV were extrapolated to \(E_{\text{F}}\) (please refer to Supplemental Material [33] for more details on the \(k_{\text{F}}\) determination). The non-SC thin film's Fermi surface shows irregularities around the hot spot, indicative of the presence of the antiferromagnetic pseudogap. The area of the Fermi surface of the non-SC Pr\(_2\)CuO\(_4\) corresponds to an electron-doping level (\(n_{\text{FS}}\)) of \(0.08 \pm 0.03\), which exceeds half-filling (\(n_{\text{FS}} = 0\)). This \(n_{\text{FS}}\) value is comparable to that of an insulating T’-type La\(_2\)CuO\(_4\) thin film (\(0.09 \pm 0.02\)), as obtained in a recent ARPES study [16].


For the SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin film, as displayed in Fig. 4 (b), the Fermi surface is satisfactorily fitted to the tight-binding model,

where $t$ , $t^{\prime}$ , and $t^{\prime\prime}$ denote the transfer integrals between the nearest-neighbor, second-nearest-neighbor, and third-nearest-neighbor Cu sites, respectively, and $\epsilon_{0}$ denotes the energy of the band center relative to the chemical potential $\mu$ . Fixing $t^{\prime\prime}/t^{\prime}$ at -0.50 in the course of the fitting, we obtained best fit for $t^{\prime}/t=-0.22$ and $\epsilon_{0}/t=-0.10$ . From the fitted Fermi surface, the electron-doping level $n_{\mathrm{FS}}$ was estimated to be 0.17 $\pm$ 0.02, which is even larger than that of the non-SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin film, consistent with the tendency found in the constant-energy surfaces at $E=E_{\mathrm{F}}-150$ meV. The experimentally determined hole-like Fermi surfaces are obviously smaller than the Fermi surface at half-filling [ $n_{\mathrm{FS}}=0$ as shown in Fig. 4 (b)], and hence one can conclude that the SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin film has a larger amount of electrons in the CuO \textsubscript{2} planes than at half-filling. The $n_{\mathrm{FS}}$ value obtained for the SC film is comparable to the Ce concentration $x$ of the SC Nd \textsubscript{2-x} Ce \textsubscript{x} CuO \textsubscript{4} and Pr \textsubscript{2-x} Ce \textsubscript{x} CuO \textsubscript{4} single crystals ( $x=0.13$ -0.17) (36) . The results are also consistent with a recent core-level spectroscopy study (20) where chemical potential of SC Nd \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin film was found to be close to that of SC Nd \textsubscript{2-x} Ce \textsubscript{x} CuO \textsubscript{4} ( $x=0.15$ –0.19) thin films. Fixing the parameters obtained by fitting the Fermi surface ( $t^{\prime}/t=-0.22$ , $t^{\prime\prime}/t^{\prime}=-0.50$ , and $\epsilon_{0}/t=-0.10$ ), the constant-energy surface of the SC film at $E=E_{\mathrm{F}}-150$ meV could be fitted to the tight-binding model with $t=0.26$ eV as displayed in Fig. 4 (a). These values of the parameters $t$ , $t^{\prime}$ , $t"$ , and $\epsilon_{0}$ are close to those of SC Nd \textsubscript{2-x} Ce \textsubscript{x} CuO \textsubscript{4} ( $x=0.15$ ) bulk single crystal ( $t=0.27$ eV, $t^{\prime}/t=-0.20$ , $t^{\prime\prime}/t^{\prime}=-0.50$ , and $\epsilon_{0}/t=-0.12$ ) estimated in a previous ARPES study (23) . Consequently, not only the carrier concentration but also the overall band structure is similar between the Ce-free and Ce-doped T’-type cuprate superconductors.

The absence of Ce in the current Pr\textsubscript{2} CuO\textsubscript{4} thin films suggests that the variation in carrier concentration is due to oxygen non-stoichiometry. The shorter $c$-axis length for the SC film implies fewer impurity apical oxygen atoms have been incorporated, but this does not fully explain the high filling level. This can only be achieved if oxygen vacancies are formed in the Ln\textsubscript{2} O\textsubscript{2} layers and/or the CuO\textsubscript{2} planes through oxygen reduction, reducing the total number of oxygen atoms in the unit formula below 4. This hypothesis aligns with the observation that $n_{\mathrm{FS}}$ is larger for SC films grown under more strongly reducing conditions. The electron concentration of $n_{\mathrm{FS}} = 0.17$ for the SC film can be explained by approximately 2% of total oxygen atoms being deficient. Given that the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of the Ce-free SC film is higher than that of optimally Ce-doped thin films (37), the small number of oxygen vacancies do not appear to negatively impact superconductivity.


Kim et al. (39) have recently discovered, using Raman spectroscopy, that apical-oxygen vacancies are an inherent characteristic in hole-doped La \textsubscript{2-x} Sr \textsubscript{x} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin films. They suggest that the electronic structure of these materials needs to be reevaluated, accounting for the presence of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen non-stoichiometry, therefore, is a common issue for cuprates and should not be disregarded. When discussing the electronic structure of cuprate superconductors, it's crucial to consider not only the total number of doped carriers, but also the oxygen occupancy, rather than focusing solely on the extent of chemical substitution.


In conclusion, we have performed ARPES measurements on SC and non-SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin films and investigated their low-energy electronic structures. The measurements were conducted by protecting the film surfaces with Se cap and removing it before the ARPES measurements. With this method, ARPES measurements on various oxide thin films potentially become possible without the use of an ARPES apparatus connected to a MBE growth chamber. The carrier concentration estimated from the Fermi surface area of the SC Pr \textsubscript{2} CuO \textsubscript{4} thin film was comparable to that of Ce-doped superconductors, and the hopping parameters and the position of the chemical potential which characterize the band structure were also similar between two types of superconductors. The electronic structure of the superconducting cuprates is strongly influenced by oxygen non-stoichiometry, and hence discussion about their physical properties should be based on the actual carrier concentration influenced by oxygen non-stoichiometry rather than the amount of chemical substitution alone.
