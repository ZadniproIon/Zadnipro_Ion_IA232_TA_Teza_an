Interlayer Conductance in the Armchair Nanotube - Zigzag Graphene Ribbon Parallel Contact: Theoretical Proposal of Detection of Wavefunction Growing from the Edge to the Center in the Graphene Ribbon

By Ryo Tamura

Abstract

Sublattices A and B are opposite in the decay direction of the edge state of the zigzag graphene ribbon (ZGR). Detecting exponential growth from the zigzag edges to the ZGR center remains challenging. The tight-binding model calculations in this letter reveal that interlayer conductance manifests this growth in parallel contact with the armchair nanotube. The transfer integrals of oblique interlayer bonds are comparable to those of vertical interlayer bonds. However, the phase of the ZGR wave function strongly suppresses the contribution of oblique bonds, allowing the selective detection of the growing component.

Carbon nanotubes (NT), discovered and gaining attention for their remarkable electronic and mechanical properties, have garnered significance due to their high aspect ratios. These properties make them ideal for applications such as tips for atomic force microscopy, Kelvin force microscopy, electrical probes, and scanning tunneling microscopy. The nanometer-sized radius ensures a high spatial resolution. Based on the chiral index ($n_{1},n_{2}$), NTs are metallic when the difference between $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ is a multiple of three (mod($n_{1}-n_{2}$, 3) =0) and semiconducting otherwise (mod($n_{1}-n_{2}$, 3) =1,2). Research in the area of single-chirality separation is still ongoing.

The primary focus of the NT tip measurement is the edge states of zigzag graphene ribbons (ZGRs), which have been examined from multiple perspectives: spin Seebeck effects, magnetism, spin transport, valleytronics, and zero-conductance dips. STM signals of these edge states are detectable at the zigzag edge but not at the armchair edge. In a conventional STM setup, the NT tip is positioned perpendicular to the ZGR surface, while the NT's $\pi$ orbitals are orthogonal to those of the ZGR. In contrast, theoretical calculations suggest that $\pi$-orbital mixing dictates the $I$-$V$ characteristics and charge distribution in parallel-contacted graphene-NT junctions. Studies on this parallel setup have been conducted, focusing on conductance and charge transfer. When the axial contact length is short, an NT with weak interlayer cohesion can be moved, maintaining a consistent interlayer distance, similar to the constant-height mode of the STM. The contact area is larger than a standard STM tip, and the current variation with slide motion provides atomistic information. Armchair NTs (ANTs) are suitable for this measurement, as they enable straightforward interlayer registration. Molecular dynamic simulations have confirmed that the ANT axis tends to be parallel to the zigzag edge due to the most stable AB stacking. In addition to the theoretical studies mentioned, interlayer vibrations and spectral functions have been studied theoretically. However, investigations of the edge state using this parallel ANT tip have not yet been reported.

In the study, we discuss the $(n,n)$ armchair nanotube (ANT) that partially overlaps with the $(n^{\prime},n^{\prime})$ zigzag grain ribbon (ZGR) as depicted in Fig. 1(a). Both ANT and ZGR share atomic coordinates with a value of y equal to $al/2$, where $a$ is the lattice constant (0.246 nm) and $l$ is an integer. The ZGR lies on the xy plane (z=0) with an AB sublattice structure, featuring B sites on the left (x=0) and A sites on the right (x = (3n'-1)ac, where ac = a/\sqrt{3} is the covalent bond length). In contrast, the ANT has an AB sublattice structure, but for clarity, we only use sublattice symbols A and B for the ZGR. The ANT's x and z coordinates are given by x = Rsinθl,j + (M-0.5)ac and z = R(cosθl,j - 1) - D, respectively, where θl,j denotes the angle π/n(j - (-1)^j/6 - (-1)^l/2) with integer j, R = (n√3a)/(2π) is the tube radius, (M-0.5)ac represents the distance between the ZGR left edge and the ANT axis, and D denotes the interlayer distance. In this definition of θl,j, the ANT covalent bond is parallel to ZGR when nearest to it. Following Ref. [40], we choose D = 0.31 nm. Both ANT and ZGR are semi-infinite in the y-direction, ending with armchair edge terminations at y=a/2(N-2) and y=0, followed by an overlapped length of a/2(N-2) with an integer N. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is defined according to the positions of the atoms, following the method outlined in Ref. [52]. The intralayer elements equal -t (-2.75 eV) for the nearest neighbors, and zero otherwise. The interlayer elements become nonzero only when the atomic distance is less than the cutoff distance rc = 0.39 nm. The nonzero element is defined as t1exp[(r1-r)/r2]cos(θl,j) with parameters t1 = 0.36 eV, r1 = 0.334 nm, and r2 = 0.045 nm. The calculations were carried out in a manner similar to that described in Ref. [54].

The diagram in Figure 1 (b) displays the atomic coordinates at positions (x, y) for cases M equal to 5 and 13. From this point forward, we use n = 5 and n' = 40. The dashed lines represent the ANT covalent bonds that point towards ZGR (cosθl,j > 0), while the ovals signify the nearest points to ZGR. Since the most stable interlayer configuration is AB stacking, we focused on the cases where M is equal to 3m + 2 and 3m + 1, with an integer m. Interlayer bonds perpendicular to the ZGR have the maximum interlayer transfer integral and are referred to as 'vertical' bonds in this context. In this scenario, the vertical bonds are only found at sites A and B, corresponding to M equal to 3m + 2 and 3m + 1, respectively. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to these cases as configurations A and B. We chose the range m ≤ 20, where m = 20 represents the center of ZGR (vertical dashed line in Figure 1 (a)).

Reference [55] shows the perturbation formula (PF) of the interlayer transmission rate $T_{\tau,\tau^{\prime}}$ from channel $\tau^{\prime}$ of the $(n^{\prime},n^{\prime})$ -ANT to channel $\tau$ of the $(n,n)$ -ANT for side-contacting ANTs (sc-ANTs). The first-order PF is determined by the perturbation Hamiltonian and zeroth order wave function i.e., interlayer Hamiltonian elements and electronic states of the isolated ANTs. In our notation, $\exp(ik_{\tau}al/2)c_{[l],j}^{\;(\tau)}$ denotes the wave function amplitude at site ( $l,j$ ) of isolate $(n,n)$ ANTs, where $c_{[l],j}^{\;(\tau)}$ is real and $k_{\tau}$ is the wave number with the channel index $\tau$ . When $l$ is odd (even), $[l]=1$ ( $[l]=2$ ). The inset in Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the linear $k$ and $k^{\prime}$ dispersion lines of the $(n,n)$ and $(n^{\prime},n^{\prime})$ ANTs where $k^{\prime}_{1}$ is omitted for simplicity. The encapsulated dopants induce the intertube-site energy difference, $\varepsilon$ .

In the case of Ref. [55] , the relations

hold and enables us to rewrite the PF as

In this context, the difference in wave numbers, denoted as $\Delta k_{\tau}$, is defined as the subtraction of $k_{\tau}$ from $k^{\prime}$. Similarly, $\Delta\widetilde{k}_{1}$ and $\Delta\widetilde{k}_{2}$ are equal to $\Delta k_{2}$ and $\Delta k_{1}$, respectively. The parameter $\sigma$ is the modulo of $N$ by 3.

and

In this case, we addressed the channel index $\tau^{\prime}$ for the $(n^{\prime},n^{\prime})$ ANT, and the interlayer Hamiltonian elements, denoted as $H^{(l,l^{\prime})}_{j,j^{\prime}}$, are defined between sites $(l,j)$ and $(l^{\prime},j^{\prime})$. The factor $(-1)^{l-l^{\prime}}$ arises from the approximation $ka\approx k^{\prime}a\approx 4\pi/3$ and significantly reduces the impact of the off-normal interlayer bonds due to its strong suppression effect.

In the proposed system's phase function (PF), $k^{\prime}$ and $c^{\prime}$ represent the wave number and wave function, respectively, of the isolated ZGR. Similar to the ANT, the ZGR sites are indexed using integers $(l^{\prime},j^{\prime})$. The PF is computed using the appropriate $k$ and $k^{\prime}$, except for the $(-1)^{l-l^{\prime}}$ factor. Unlike the ANT, the ZGR's $k^{\prime}$ dispersion line is markedly nonlinear, and the derivatives $\frac{dk^{\prime}}{dE}$, $\Delta k_{1}$ and $\Delta k_{2}$ deviate from those in Eq. (2), Eq. (3), and Eq. (4).

The primary panel of Figure 2 showcases the dispersion relations of the studied system. The 'x' marks depict the wave numbers, k1 and k2, of the isolated (5,5) ANT, which are identical to those shown in the inset. On the other hand, the circles signify the isolated (40,40) ZGR and represent a solitary dispersion line for the edge state close to zero energy. In Figure 2, the horizontal arrows signify the measured $\Delta k_{\tau}$ using $k^{\prime}$. Despite the absence of an interlayer site energy difference, in our system, the difference between linear and flat bands acts effectively as an energy-dependent $\varepsilon$. Since our interest lies in the zigzag edge state, we concentrated on the energy region, $|E|<0.177$ eV, where only a single edge channel exists in the ZGR asymptotic region, y>(N-2)a/2. This energy range is inversely related to $n^{\prime}$.

The wave function for ANT is straightforward due to the values of $c_{l,j}^{(2)}$ being $-1^{j}$ and $c_{l,j}^{(1)}$ equal to 1. In contrast, the wave function for ZGR (represented as $c^{\prime}_{l,j}$ ) is more complex, as detailed in Reference [56]. Figure 3 illustrates the squared amplitude $|c^{\prime}_{l,j}|^{2}$ as a function of the position along the x-axis for energies of -0.007 eV and -0.001 eV. The B-site amplitude is localized at the left edge and decays exponentially with increasing x. On the other hand, the A-site amplitude increases exponentially and matches the B-site amplitude at the center, specifically at $x=60a_{\rm c}$. As the magnitude of E increases, the edge state becomes less localized.

The solid lines in the main panel of Fig. 2 represent the wave number $k_{\rm int}$ where the interlayer Hamiltonian corresponds to the scattering region $0\leq y\leq(N-2)a/2$ in case $M=16$ (configuration B). Owing to the ANT curvature, the interlayer bonds only appear when $\cos\theta_{l,j}\simeq 1$ . This curvature effect causes the $k_{\rm int}$ dispersion lines extremely close to $k$ and $k^{\prime}$ except for the narrow energy gaps at the $k$ - $k^{\prime}$ cross (the solid lines are displayed only near the crossing). Because of the B-site localization, the gap is wider in configuration B than in configuration A when the ANT is near the left edge. For example, the gap regions are $-46$ meV $<E<-31$ meV and 33 meV $<E<$ 47 meV in case $M=16$ (Fig. 2), and $-38$ meV $<E<-37$ meV and 38 meV $<E<$ 40 meV for $M=17$ (not shown in the figures). Equations ( 2 ), ( 3 ), and ( 4 ) does not hold for the present system, as previously mentioned. The PF is calculated using $k^{\prime}$ and $c^{\prime}$ of the isolate ZGR. In contrast to sc-ANT, whether we can prove the PF of the present system is yet to be determined. However, it should be noted that Eq. ( 6 ) is a factor of Fermi’s golden rule. [57] By comparing Eq. ( 5 ) with the exact transmission rates, we evaluate the effectiveness of Eq. ( 5 ). The same tight-binding Hamiltonian was applied to both the exact calculation and perturbation formula.

Figure 4 depicts the sum of transmission rates, denoted as T_s, calculated using Landauer’s formula conductance in units of 2e^2/h, as a function of the axial overlap length N. This is presented only for cases where mod(N,3) = 0. The plot shows the transmission rates for two methods: exact calculation and the perturbation function (PF) approach. The PF becomes less effective for larger values of N due to the total interlayer interaction, proportional to N, becoming too substantial to be considered as a perturbation. However, the PF yields accurate results within a specific range of N, as demonstrated in Figure 4. This effective range of N is evident; the PF accurately reproduces the exact T_s values for N less than 9, 50, 100, and 100 when E equals -1, 39, 79, and 119 meV. As the absolute value of E increases, the effective range of N also increases. This dependence on E likely arises from the edge bands; when E is sufficiently large, the gradient of the edge band approaches √(3)/2 * ta, supporting the applicability of the sc-ANT theory. When E equals -1 meV, the PF underestimates the dips in T_s for N. Specifically, the PF predicts dips at N = 78 and 153, while the exact calculation shows dips at N = 90 and 168. Additionally, when the PF's T_s exceeds 1, the exact T_s approaches the maximum, that is, 1. Similar effectiveness of the PF was observed for mod(N,3) = 1, 2, and configuration A (not shown in Figure).

The Perpendicular Field (PF) is effective even when the energy difference, $|E|$, is as small as 1 meV, with a small axial overlap length, $N$, of 3. For our calculations, we have chosen $N=3$. This small overlap length, $(N-2)a/2=a/2$, diminishes interlayer cohesion, promoting smooth sliding of the ANT on the ZGR. Figure 5 (a) presents the total transmission rate, $T_{s}$, as a function of the ANT position index, $m$, in configuration B ( $M=3m+1$). The triangles represent exact calculations, squares represent PF calculations, and circles represent $Y_{1}+Y_{2}$. Open and solid symbols depict data for $E=-1$ meV and $E=-7$ meV, respectively. Figure 5 (b) mirrors Fig. 5 (a), but with a switch from B to A configuration. The PF accurately captures the variations in $T_{s}$ with $m$. When $|E|\approx 0$ and $(|\Delta k_{1}|-|\Delta k_{2}|)N\ll 1$, Eq. (5) demonstrates that $T_{s}/(Y_{1}+Y_{2})$ is constant, indicating a strong correlation between $T_{s}$ and the ZGR wave function amplitude, $|c^{\prime}|^{2}$. Figure 5 (a) shows the exponential localization of the B site, as seen in Fig. 3. An increase in $|E|$ causes delocalization. The $T_{s}$ and B-site amplitudes in Fig. 3 share the same slope on the semi-log scale. In contrast, Fig. 5 (b) does not necessarily indicate B localization. In configuration A, only the A sites of ZGR are connected vertically. Although the B sites are also connected to ANT by oblique interlayer bonds, the factor $(-1)^{l-l^{\prime}}$ in Eq. (7) significantly reduces the contribution of B sites to Eq. (7) for configuration A. In the open symbols ($E=-1$ meV) near the left edge ($m<10$), the A amplitude is negligible, and B-site localization appears. As $m$ increases, the A-site amplitude increases and approaches the decaying B-site amplitude, causing the open symbols to increase with $m$. In the solid symbols ($E=-7$ meV), the difference between the A and B sites decreases, as shown in Fig. 3, and the suppression of the B site amplitude in Eq. (5) becomes more significant than in the $E=-1$ meV case. Thus, the solid symbols reflect the A-site amplitude, which increases exponentially with $m$.

Although the ZGR exhibits localization at its edges, the phase relationship within the ZGR cancels the decaying wave on the B-site, allowing for the detection of the growing wave function on the A-site, moving from the edge towards the center. This growth signal can be detected using a conventional STM tip, though this has not yet been reported. The edge roughness may affect the amplitude growth, but moderate edge roughness does not significantly alter the sublattice amplitude difference in the theoretical calculations of Refs. [17]. The thermal vibration and deviation from the AB stacking configuration break the relation between adjacent layers' Hamiltonians, $H^{(l.l+1)}=H^{(l,l-1)}$, and weaken the $(-1)^{l-l^{\prime}}$ cancellation in Eq. (7). Future studies should address these issues. The vertical axis range in Fig. 5 is noteworthy. The minimum in Fig. 5 (a) is close to the maximum in Fig. 5 (b). To detect the amplitude increase according to the interlayer configuration, the ammeter range must be adjusted by several orders of magnitude. Fortunately, the ANT-ZGR junction prefers the AB stacking configuration. By moving the ANT tip along the armchair edge (where y = 0), the stable configurations A and B alternate, helping to manage the ammeter range based on the configurations A and B. The estimated barrier height is 4 meV. [58] While a more accurate Hamiltonian and atomic structure may be required for a quantitative analysis, the main result – detecting the wave function growth from the edge to the center – is independent of the specifics of the model. As the overlap between opposite decay components governs the spin coupling between opposite edges, this detection provides valuable insights into ZGR magnetism [19], which increases the potential for using the ANT tip in graphene-related studies.

[58] According to Ref.[47], the barrier height between the neighboring stable sites is about 60 meV with an axial overlap length of 2 nm(N≃15)similar-to-or-equals𝑁15(N\simeq 15). We assume that the barrier height is proportional toN𝑁N.
