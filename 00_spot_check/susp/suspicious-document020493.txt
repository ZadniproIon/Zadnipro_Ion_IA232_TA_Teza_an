Abstract

In our analysis, we found variability in the relative intensities of components I, II, III, and IV across different observations and our own radio maps. For case A, these components align with the source position, while in case B they are further away, and in case C they are closer to the precession axis. The position of these components is solely influenced by the dynamics of the jet, while their intensities are primarily determined by the radiation mechanism. Our self-consistent simulations reveal that the canonical kinematic model for SS433 does not accurately depict the actual bright components' positions, with the discrepancy increasing with distance from the source. This is due to the model's lack of consideration for the increased interaction between the jet and the ISM caused by precession and previous deceleration history. Compared to the ballistic behavior of this model, our simulation case A provides a better fit with the observations by incorporating actual dynamics. Case B results in a poor match, as the radio components escape the source too quickly, and case C fails due to the components remaining too close to the precession axis. All cases accounted for Doppler effects, with negligible differences in intensity between the upper and lower radio components for cases A and C due to the jet's low velocity. In contrast, case B exhibits a significant difference in intensity between the upper and lower components, suggesting a higher Lorentz factor. Comparing this with the observation, we find little difference in intensity between the top and bottom radio components for SS433, leading us to reject the possibility of a different jet speed from the observed $0.26c$. Zavala et al. (2008) employed a 10-degree precession angle in their model to replicate the interaction of SS433 with the supernova remnant W50 at a scale of 20pc. Case C was designed to explore whether this angle could also reproduce the radio observation at subparsec scale, but our findings indicate that it does not. We conclude that either the precessing jet undergoes recollimation between the two scales, or the precession angle of SS433 has evolved during its history.

1. Introduction

A variety of astrophysical objects generate non-relativistic to highly relativistic jets, including young stellar jets and electromagnetically driven jets in pulsar wind nebulae. High-luminosity jets are identified through radio observations in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRB), also known as microquasar systems. The energy transfer from these jets to their surroundings is of significant interest due to the efficient method it provides for transferring energy from small structures to larger ones. Studies of AGN and XRB jets are closely related and play a role in cosmological evolution by feeding back energy to galaxy clusters. This study employs numerical simulations to quantify the energy transfer from the jet to its surroundings, focusing on the impact of a precessing jet motion. This precession, exemplified in the SS433 XRB system, necessitates full 3D simulations and involves dropping the assumption of axisymmetry commonly used in studies on relativistic jet propagation.

As a consequence of the short cooling times, we expect a large amount of cool gas and high star formation rate in these clusters. However, X-ray observations made by Chandra and XMM-Newton Peterson et al. (2003) did not find a large amount of cool gas in CC galaxy clusters, and the observed star formation rate is much lower than predicted Edge (2001) . Non-gravitational energy input into CC clusters seems to be necessary to solve this, the so called “cooling flow”, problem. This energy input is most likely self-regulated, since it should provide sufficient heat to quench the cooling, but at the same time it should not be so strong as to overheat and destroy the cool core. The most likely sources providing the sufficient heating to prevent the intracluster gas from runaway cooling are active galactic nuclei (AGNs) located at the center of CC clusters McNamara & Nulsen (2007) , but the exact physical mechanism which distributes that heat is still not known.

 Researchers have utilized a wide range of observations at various scales to investigate the SS433 system. At a distance of 20 parsecs, the interaction between SS433's jet and the supernova remnant W50, as described by Dubner et al. (1998), can be observed. Simulations in 3 dimensions by Zavala et al. (2008) suggest a potential time-dependent development of the precession angle for SS433, ranging from 10 to 20 degrees. Focusing on smaller scales, around 1 astronomical unit, VLBA and VLBI provide a clearer understanding of the close vicinity of the binary system. These observations reveal a discontinuous jet launch pattern with significant variability, as well as X-ray and radio emissions emanating from the central region, as reported by Paragi et al. (1999). A film was released in 2004 depicting the time-dependent evolution of its emission over approximately 40 days, which is roughly one quarter of its precession period. For our study, we concentrate on scales of around 0.1 parsecs. Detailed radio observations, particularly from the VLA observatory, reveal a helical pattern due to precession, as observed by Spencer (1979). Typically, these observations are overlapped with the widely adopted kinematic model for SS433. This model assumes a distance to SS433 of 5.5 kiloparsecs, as stated by Roberts et al. (2008). Although this model aligns well with observations, discrepancies between the model and specific details can sometimes occur, motivating us to produce radio maps from our simulations to compare them with observations and the standard kinematic model.

It was proposed and demonstrated by Falceta-Gonçalves et al. (2010) that the combined effect of star formation and AGN feedback to prevent the cooling catastrophe. More recently, Li et al. (2015) demonstrated that momentum-driven AGN feedback and star formation can prevent the cooling catastrophe producing self-regulated cycles of accretion by the central supermassive black hole, which heats the gas, followed by gas cooling until the next cycle. This model is mainly consistent with most observations (but, e.g., occasionally, it does produce higher star formation rate and cooling rate than observations imply). However, more work is needed to improve the model parameters and include more physics (e.g., transport processes and magnetic fields, which may provide additional pressure support, and likely suppress star formation and lower the star formation rate; van Loo et al. (2015) ). Magnetic fields are essential in launching and collimating the jets, but perhaps less important for jets propagating on extragalactic scales Pudritz et al. (2012) . Most recent magneto-hydrodynamical simulations including AGN feedback, cooling, and anisotropic conduction due to the jet magnetic field show that the main sources of heating are still AGNs, however, conduction may contribute to heating significantly in the most massive clusters only if the maximum Spitzer conductivity is adopted along magnetic field lines Yang & Reynolds (2016) .

The collisions of jets are extremely energetic events, thus they offer a unique opportunity to study astrophysical plasma under extreme conditions and infer the physical properties of jets based on the comparison of hydrodynamical (and magneto-hydrodynamical) simulations with observations. Jet collisions are also rare, but radio observations of the double twin-jet system, 3C 75, located in NGC 1128 at the center of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 400, suggest that there are two colliding jets Hudson et al. (2006) . In Figure 1 we show superimposed radio and optical images of the centre of 3C 75. The western jet from the northern AGN appears to collide with, and merge into, the northern jet from the southern AGN which does not seem to change its course significantly.

In our research, we employed a block-tree adaptive mesh refinement technique and implemented an evolving boundary condition to simulate precessing bipolar supersonic jets. Parameters derived from observations were utilized. Multiple 3D jet simulations, with varying density contrast and beam velocity, were compared, all of which were designed to match the kinetic flux of the SS433 jet. We monitored the energy distribution within the domain influenced by the jet. Our computational model enables the tracking of the adiabatic cooling of a group of relativistic particles emitted by the jet. The evolving energy distribution of accelerated electrons, represented by a pressure-based approximation of the magnetic field, enabled us to generate the radio emission from our simulation.

In the ensuing discussion, we commence by elucidating our approach, detailing the mathematical models employed for the hydrodynamic simulations and the synthetic radio mapping. The subsequent section outlines the instruments and analytical techniques utilized to scrutinize the simulations. The exposition of our findings is segmented into three distinct parts: initially, we offer a visual portrayal of the various scenarios, accompanied by preliminary remarks and observations. Subsequently, we delve into the results of a succession of diagnostic tests executed on our simulations, which shed light on the energy exchange between the jet and its environment and the influence of precession in contrast to the variation of free parameters in our model. Lastly, the third component of our findings encompasses the radio maps we generated and juxtaposes them against actual radio observations of SS433. We conclude by offering some overarching insights drawn from this research endeavor.

2. Hydrodynamical Simulations of Colliding Jets

The primary characteristic of the SS433 jet is its propensity to precess, thereby prompting the exploration of potential discrepancies in fluid dynamics between a stationary and a precessing jet. Given our previous research (Monceau-Baroux et al., 2012) , which focused on the hydrodynamic behavior of non-precessing jets, specifically axisymmetric 2D jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN), we extended our study to jets originating from X-ray binaries (XRB). Despite the vast disparities in scale and total energy output, the dynamics of these two types of jets are believed to bear striking similarities, as both are ejected from the central regions of an accretion disk surrounding a compact object, be it a black hole (for AGN) or a massive companion (for XRB).

In the case of non-precessing, continuously injected relativistic hydro jets, the interaction with the surroundings encompasses four crucial elements: the conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy via internal shocks within the jet beam, as well as those resulting from recollimation when injected at a finite opening angle, and ahead of the jet at the overarching bow shock. The latter plays a far more significant role in the conversion of energy. Within the medium shocked by the impact, multiple traversing shocks are detected, generated at the dynamically changing interface between the jet and its shocked surroundings, thereby heating the shocked medium. Lastly, various fluid instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Taylor) arise around the jet, causing the mixing of jet and surrounding medium.

In our initial investigation of the precessing XRB jet, we elected to compare it directly with a 3D stationary counterpart, thereby identifying which mechanisms persist and assessing their respective significance.

In this discourse, we delve into three specific scenarios: a jet traveling at the standard SS433 speed (Case A: $\gamma=1.036$, $v_{b}=0.26c$), a faster precessing jet (Case B: $\gamma=1.87$, $v_{b}=0.845c$), and its non-precessing counterpart (Case D: $\gamma=1.87$, $v_{b}=0.845c$). The analysis between Case A and B sheds light on the impact of the Lorentz factor on the dynamics of precessing jets, while Case D serves to study precession's influence on mildly relativistic jets. A comprehensive overview of these scenarios can be found in Figure 3. Cases A and B are depicted at a simulated time of 2, which equates to 6.53 years in the complete evolution, whereas Case D is displayed at 0.25, or 0.82 years, due to its early exit from the domain. With a precession period of 162 days, a simulated time of 2 corresponds to 14.7 precessions of the source. On a 2D plane, we plot the density, and a 3D representation is achieved through the use of the advected tracer described in section 2.4. Pressure is measured within this volume.

We used a modified version of the GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement (AMR) hydrodynamical parallel code ( GAMER ) developed at the National Taiwan University Schive et al. (2010) to carry out our simulations of colliding jets. GAMER adopts a novel approach in improving the performance of astrophysical numerical simulations. It uses GPUs for solving the partial differential equations, for example, hydrodynamics, self-gravity, and magnetohydrodynamics (Zhang et al., in preparation), and uses CPUs for manipulating the AMR data structure. The parallel performance has been highly optimized by implementing (1) hybrid MPI/OpenMP/GPU parallelization, (2) concurrent execution between multiple CPUs and GPUs, (3) asynchronous data transfer between CPUs and GPUs, and (4) Hilbert space-filling curve for load balancing. The code supports a variety of hydrodynamic schemes. In this work we adopt the corner-transport-upwind method Colella (1990) , Roe’s Riemann solver Roe (1981) , and the piecewise parabolic data reconstruction Colella & Woodward (1984) . The overall performance using these schemes is measured to be $\sim 7\times 10^{7}$ cell updates per second on a single NVIDIA K40 GPU, which is found to be two orders of magnitude faster than a single CPU core and one order of magnitude faster than a ten-core CPU using an Intel Xeon E5-2670 v2 CPU at 2.50 GHz. The accuracy of GAMER has been carefully verified Schive et al. (2010) . We also tested GAMER by comparing results of bipolar single jet simulations carried out with GAMER and the publicly available and extensively tested Eulerian parallel code FLASH developed at the University of Chicago Fryxell et al. (2000) .

GAMER solves the Euler equations in conservation form. In this case, in Cartesian coordinates, $(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$ , the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations may be expressed as: 
 
 $\displaystyle\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}(\rho\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{j})$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle 0$  (1) 
 
 $\displaystyle\frac{\partial(\rho\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{i})}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}(\rho\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{i}\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{j}+p\delta_{ij})$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle 0$  (2) 
 
 $\displaystyle\frac{\partial e}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j}}[(e+p)\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{j}]$ $\displaystyle=$ $\displaystyle 0,$  (3) 
 where $\rho$ , $p$ , and $e$ are the mass density, the thermal pressure, and the total energy density of the gas, $e=(1/2)\rho\mbox{\boldmath$v$}^{2}+\epsilon$ , where $\epsilon$ is the internal energy density, $\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{i}$ and $\mbox{\boldmath$v$}_{j}$ are the components of the flow velocity vector, ${\bf v}$ , and the spatial indices, $i$ , and $j$ take a value of 1, 2, or 3. All dependent physical variables are evaluated at position ${\bf r}=(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$ and time $t$ (we suppressed the independent variables for clarity). This set of equations is closed by using the equation of state for ideal gas: 
 
 $p=(\gamma-1)\,\epsilon,$  (4) 
 where $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats. For monoatomic classical and ultra-relativistic ideal gases, the adiabatic index changes between 5/3 and 4/3. We adopt $\gamma\leq 5/3$ as a good approximation, since we assume that the jet temperatures are in the non-relativistic regime ( $T_{jet}\ll 10^{5}$ keV; e.g., Mignone & McKinney (2007) ).

2.1. Initial Conditions for Colliding Jets

We preformed simulations of two bipolar jets with different injection velocities, cross sections, densities, and temperatures for the jets and the ambient gas. In this paper we present simulations relevant to our qualitative analysis of colliding extragalactic jets.

In the initial analysis of the three cases, several notable observations have been made. Case D, the non-precessing scenario, has already extended beyond the simulation boundaries at the 0.82-year mark (t=0.25), whereas cases A and B remain within the domain at t=2, with case A exhibiting a longer reach. The morphology of the jet differs significantly between precessing and non-precessing jets; case D demonstrates a circular cross-section, consistent with extensive studies of relativistic AGN or XRB jets. Conversely, precessing cases show a helical beam with a ribbon-like appearance, characterized by a low-pressure, extended region at the rear of each annulus and a high-pressure zone on the front side. This pressure distribution resembles that of a propagating piston, with high pressure building in front and pressure dropping behind due to adiabatic expansion. Given the simulation box size of 0.2x0.1x0.1 pc3, adopting the beam velocity vb, case A and B would cover their maximal expansion of 0.1 pc in 1.25 and 0.39 years, respectively, completing approximately 2.8 and 0.9 precessions. Both simulations show a higher number of windings within the box and have undergone more precession during propagation. Case A is evidently characterized by four complete precession windings (648 days), implying an overall jet speed of propagation of vhead=0.185c, suggesting possible deceleration in precessing jets.

In the initial analysis, three cases were examined, revealing several key findings. Case D, the non-precessing scenario, had reached and surpassed the simulation boundaries within 0.82 years (t=0.25), signifying a faster progression. In contrast, cases A and B remained confined within the domain at t=2, with case A exhibiting a more extensive reach. The morphology of the jet varies significantly between precessing and non-precessing jets. Case D presents a circular cross-section, typical of extensive studies of AGN and XRB relativistic jets. Meanwhile, precessing cases A and B show a helical structure, resembling a ribbon with a low-pressure extended section at the rear of each annulus, while the front side exhibits a high-pressure zone. This pressure pattern mirrors that of a propagating piston, with high pressure building in front and pressure dropping behind due to adiabatic expansion. Given the simulation box size of 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.1 pc³, with the adopted beam velocity vb, case A and B would expand to cover 0.1 pc in 1.25 and 0.39 years respectively, completing 2.8 and 0.9 precessions. Both simulations demonstrated a higher number of windings within the box, and underwent more precession during their propagation. Case A exhibited four complete precession windings (648 days), suggesting an overall jet speed of propagation of vhead = 0.185c, hinting at deceleration experienced by the precessing jet.

For a professional audience, the paragraph describes a simulation of a precessing bipolar jet. The jet is initialized by overwriting the values within a sphere at the center of the domain, and its orientation is determined by the position of its axis, which precesses around a fixed point on the precession axis. The jet's interior follows a conical shape with a radius equal to the absolute value of the $z$-coordinate multiplied by the jet opening angle. The jet radius on entry is determined by the intersection of the cone with a sphere of a specific radius, and the velocity within the precessing cone is purely radial. The density and pressure within the jet cone are inversely proportional to the square of the radius, and the rest of the domain is set to a uniform Interstellar Medium (ISM). All parameters for the initial condition and the geometry for all cases can be found in provided tables.


In historical instances, the jet's propagation results in a bow shock that advances at the same speed as the jet head's supersonic velocity. For cases A and B, we observed Mach numbers of 6 and 22, respectively, relative to the ISM's sound speed. Over time, the position of the bow shock and the jet head may become detached, as the jet head slows to subsonic velocity while the jet material remains supersonic. Notably, case D maintains a continuous propagation, and no such clear detachment is observed during the simulation period. Cases A and B, however, exhibit detachment at times 0.5 and 0.25, respectively. The velocity of the bow shock in these cases reaches 0.05c, surpassing the ISM sound speed of 0.04c. By examining a 2D cut of the domain (figure 7), we note that the sound speed within the cocoon is greater than the ISM sound speed in cases A and B ( $c_{s,cocoon}>c_{s,ISM}=0.04c$ ). The sound speed in the jet region can exceed 0.1c, while in the SISM region, it generally matches the measured velocity of the bow shock. The discontinuity between the cocoon and the ISM travels a short distance ahead of the transfer surface located by $r_{\mathrm{head}}(t)$ following detachment from the bow shock. This transfer surface, or Mach disk in the case of static jets, is the location where energy conversion from kinetic to thermal takes place. Both the discontinuity and the transfer surface share a similar velocity, as predicted by simple 1D models of relativistic jets. This behavior is also observed in 2D relativistic jets, as reported by Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012).

3. Results

In the presented analysis, we provide quantifiable data on various scenarios. Figure 4 details the findings: the upper panel depicts the maximum velocity profile over radius at four distinct time intervals for cases A, B, and D. This maximum velocity profile signifies the peak velocity value at each radial distance from the source, $v_{b}(r)=\max(v(r))$, offering insights into the spatial distribution of the beam velocity within the system. Notably, the definition of this profile incorporates contributions from both counter-directed jets. The lower panels of Figure 4 illustrate the temporal evolution of the jet head, contact discontinuity, and front shock, using the approach outlined in section 2.4.

In Figure 5, we employed the aforementioned method to evaluate the energy deposition characteristics. Two challenges emerged when analyzing the energy content of the various regions in our simulations. Initially, we adopted a sharp initial profile for our initial condition, disregarding both SISM and cocoon, with the jet directly interfacing with the undisturbed ISM at t=0. This necessitated some time for the simulation to transition to a more physiologically relevant state (estimated at t=0.15, 0.15, and 0.025 for cases A, B, and D, respectively). Secondly, to manage the simulation's cost, we utilized a compact box with open boundaries, enabling dynamics to pass through the boundaries. This allowed energy to exit the box during later stages of the simulation (estimated at t=1, 1.2, and 0.23 for cases A, B, and D, respectively). This phenomenon is evident in the energy graphs for cases A and B, where the excess energy fraction within the SISM-dominated portion of the domain decreases rapidly as the SISM begins to permeate the boundaries, with both the jet and cocoon still confined within the domain. These factors complicate our energy measurements at later times. However, we can still derive conclusions from the overall trend of the energy graphs.

The first inference is drawn by comparing cases A and B. In case A, the majority of the injected energy remains within the jet itself, exceeding both the cocoon and SISM regions. Conversely, in case B, the highest energy fraction is found in the SISM, followed by the cocoon, with only one third of it remaining within the jet region. This is a consequence of the interaction between the jet and the ISM, influenced by jet precession and its contrast in inertia. A significantly higher fraction of energy is transferred from the jet to the ISM as the Lorentz factor (case A: 1.036; case B: 1.87) increases, confirming that case A propagated almost freely in the ISM, while case B initially inflates a hot cocoon within which it can subsequently propagate. Both cases A and D (with no precession for case D) exhibit a high energy fraction remaining within the jet. The two cases have different inertia ratios between the jet and the ISM (case A: 28.6; case D: 0.8). The low energy transfer in case D is due to different reasons: for case A, the high inertia ratio allows the jet to travel freely despite the large interaction surface due to precession. In contrast, for case D, the inertia ratio should promote more interaction, but the interaction surface is significantly smaller compared to all other cases. Without precession, we have a correction factor for the 1D Marti equation (see section 3.1) equal to 1. However, where the cocoon region receives almost no energy in case D, almost 20% of the deposited energy is transferred to the cocoon for case A. If we include this along with the contribution to the SISM region, we observe that approximately 40% of the deposited energy is transferred from the jet to the medium for case A, compared to approximately 20% for case D. Once more, we see that precession leads to an increased interaction between the jet and its surroundings.

In the ensuing analysis, we concentrate on three specific scenarios: a jet moving at the standard speed of SS433, Case A (Lorentz factor 1.036, bulk velocity 0.26c), a precessing Case B with an increased speed, resulting in an underdense jet (Lorentz factor 1.87, bulk velocity 0.845c), and its non-precessing counterpart, Case D (Lorentz factor 1.87, bulk velocity 0.845c). Analyzing Case A and B provides insights into the influence of the Lorentz factor on the dynamics of a precessing jet, while comparing Case D with the other two allows for the examination of precession's impact on the dynamics of moderately relativistic jets. A comprehensive perspective on these three scenarios is provided in Figure 3. Cases A and B are depicted at a dimensionless time of 2 from the simulation, which equates to 6.53 years in the overall duration, whereas Case D is shown at 0.25, or 0.82 year, due to its jet exiting the domain prematurely. With a precession period of 162 days, a dimensionless time of 2 corresponds to 14.7 precessions of the source. On a 2D plane, we illustrate the density, whereas a volume rendering is achieved through the tracer described in Section 2.4. On this volume, we have measured pressure.

In the study of Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012), it is evident that for the non-precessing case D, a structured beam coalesces around the jet, with the surrounding medium being propelled forward by the jet's head much like a piston. This phenomenon arises due to an extreme adiabatic expansion occurring behind the jet's material, resulting in an outer layer of the beam with low density and pressure. Conversely, pressure and density accumulate ahead of the jet's head. Remarkably, several distinguishing characteristics of relativistic jets, such as an internal recollimation shock and a robust interaction at the jet's head, are also discernible in case D. It is worth noting that a significant proportion of the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy at this specific location. Further energy transfers occur through the instabilities that emerge at the head of the jet, which subsequently propagate along its length.

Upon analyzing the radial velocity profile displayed in figure 4's top row, it is apparent that it consists of a three-segment architecture. The initial segment is flat and unaccelerated close to the source, followed by a region of consistent deceleration, and finally a third segment where the radial profile exhibits a bend, suggesting a softening deceleration. This pattern is particularly noticeable in case B, as the curve for time t=1 reveals an inflection point, or 'ankle', at a distance of 0.065 parsecs, with the cessation of deceleration occurring at 0.09 parsecs, where the velocity profile becomes zero. The radial extent graph for the same case indicates that at t=1, the endpoint of the jet beam and the position of the front shock are 0.065 parsecs and 0.09 parsecs, respectively. This region thus lies beyond the cocoon, within the SISM region. The fact that the velocity remains non-zero provides explicit proof that the SISM is being propelled to mildly relativistic speeds, such as 0.03c in case B. Shocks serve to impart energy to the SISM region, a phenomenon we know from previous research (Monceau-Baroux et al., 2012) to be largely thermal. However, in the case of precessing jets, we observe that they also contribute to the acceleration of the SISM medium, as they bring kinetic energy to the SISM. This phenomenon is also observable in case A. In case D, as previously stated, the Mach disk and the front shock are not clearly distinguishable, hence this characteristic is absent.

The research focused on two aspects of our hydrodynamic study: a parametric analysis examining the influence of the Lorentz factor, with the kinetic flux maintained constant and linked to the jet density via equation (4). The initial findings indicate that case A, with a lower Lorentz factor (γ=1.036), is denser than its surroundings, resulting in minimal interaction as the jet easily traversed the medium. Energy analysis showed that the majority (60%) of the energy was retained within the jet itself, with less than 40% dispersed throughout SISM and the cocoon. Conversely, case B, with a higher Lorentz factor (γ=1.87), exhibited significant interaction. Being underdense compared to the ISM, more than 70% of the energy was transferred to the surroundings. Case D, with a fixed propagation direction, experienced minimal energy transfer (less than 30%) with a negligible amount entering the cocoon. In AGN or XRB, the density ratio between the jet and the ISM is crucial for the interaction between the jet and its surroundings. Three primary mechanisms of interaction or energy transfer were identified: the first being the conversion of kinetic to thermal energy at the front shock of the jet, primarily occurring at the Mach disk for non-precessing jets. The second mechanism involves material mixing from the jet and surroundings due to instabilities. Lastly, shocks formed by the jet-beam propagation can heat the surroundings. Precession enhances these interactions substantially, as it extends the interaction front beyond the jet surface and makes the particular interaction present along the jet's length, rather than just at the head. For the density ratio, it was observed that the helical shape of underdense jets does not persist for long. This lends support to overdense jet models, such as case A with a Lorentz factor of γ=1.036 or an injection velocity of vj=0.26c. Additionally, there is a lack of knowledge about quickly precessing AGN jets that are widely assumed to be underdense.

The radio map of Case D (Figure 10) demonstrates characteristics common in relativistic jet studies. The Doppler effect, caused by the jet-axis's angle with the observer's line of sight, amplifies emission from the jet heading towards the observer while reducing it from the jet pointing away. This pattern is evident in the 3C 296 observation by Laing et al. (2006). In the case of statically injected relativistic jets, recollimation shocks are known to form, as observed in Case D (Figure 8). These shocks are thought to be sites of particle acceleration within the jet, leading to brightening and explaining the observed bright blobs along relativistic jets, such as in M87 and Cyg A. It should be noted that particle acceleration in shocks was not considered in our simulation (Section 2.2). However, our radio maps of Case D (Figure 10) show the emergence of bright spots, suggesting that the fluid compression at recollimation shocks may be responsible for the formation of emission blobs, even without considering particle acceleration.

To perpetually delineate the distinct zones within the domain influenced by jet progression, we employed a pair of complementary techniques. A passive marker, tracking the jet's development, enabled us to pinpoint regions exclusively comprised of jet main material. The second method, first utilized in our axisymmetric jet simulations as described in Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012), employs data with instantaneous versus initial conditions to identify the entire region altered by jet transit. This passive marker, denoted as $\rho_{\mathrm{tr}}$, evolves in tandem with the flux of density, as indicated by the equation:

 $\bigtriangledown_{\mu}(\rho\rho_{\mathrm{tr}}u^{\mu})=0\,.$  (6)

It was initialized to the density value in the jet's injection region ( $\rho_{\mathrm{tr0}}=\rho_{b}$ , where $\rho_{b}$ was derived from equation 4 ) and set to zero elsewhere. By doing so, we could identify the jet's core where the marker persists, $\rho_{\mathrm{tr}}\geqslant 0.1\rho_{\mathrm{tr0}}$ . This demarcation served to find the most remote position of the jet's head at any given time: $r_{\mathrm{head}}(t)$ signifies the maximum radial distance from the central source where jet material remains present. Interestingly, in the precessing case, we did not discern the formation of a Mach disk, as observed in studies of non-precessing AGN jets or in our own investigation, D. Instead, where the marker exhibits a non-zero value but is less than 0.1 $\rho_{\mathrm{tr0}}$ , we identified the entire jet cocoon, which also provided the location of the boundary between matter derived from the jet and the interstellar medium (ISM), along with the shocked interstellar medium (SISM): thus, $r_{\mathrm{disc}}(t)$ represents the maximum radial distance at which the jet cocoon extends at a specific time $t$. The shocked ISM can then be found in all regions where the energy excess surpasses zero. This energy excess is defined as the disparity between the local energy (both thermal and kinetic) at the observed time and the energy at the same location in the initial condition: $E_{excess}(\@vec{x},t)=E_{tot}(\@vec{x},t)-E_{ini}(\@vec{x},t=0)$, where $E_{tot}=E_{therm}+E_{kin}$ is the total instantaneous energy calculated by summing kinetic and thermal energy. Note that this excess energy serves as the energy metric in section 3.2 for quantifying energy transfer. $E_{ini}=E_{therm,ini}+E_{kin,ini}$ is the total energy at time $t=0$ (it is important to note that at time $t=0$, the kinetic term is non-zero only within the jet region since the overwritten sphere at the domain's center is incorporated in the calculation). This region determines the location of the front shock, where $r_{\mathrm{SISM}}(t)$ once more signifies the maximum radial distance discovered from the energy excess locator. By isolating solely the shocked ISM region, or the jet cocoon regions, we ensured that the different regions did not overlap, which implies that we excluded the jet region from all other regions, and similarly, the cocoon from the shocked ISM and the shocked ISM from the unaffected ISM region. A visual example of such filtering for case A at time $t=1$ can be seen in figure 2.

A trend can be seen clearly in Figure 6 : the spread increases as the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet increases. The jets merge when the impact parameter and the velocity of the second jet are small (magenta and dark blue pixels; P000V10, P000V12, P000V14, P015V10, P015V12, and P030V10, see Table 1 ), otherwise they bounce. Since the $x$ components of the velocities of the jets have opposite signs, the relative value of this component decreases (it should be zero for v \textsubscript{1} = v \textsubscript{2} ), and, as a consequence, the angle between the bouncing jets decreases as does the spread between them. This is the reason for the increasing spread with increasing impact parameter (left to right in Figure 6 ). Even though both jets propagate in the positive $y$ direction, the $y$ component of the velocities of both jets decreases because, as they collide, they generate more turbulence and drive more waves as they propagate due to the increased instabilities.

In the study by Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012), a structured beam is formed in the non-precessing case D (Figure 8) due to the medium being pushed by the jet head, resembling a piston effect. The outer layer of this beam exhibits low density and pressure as a result of extreme adiabatic expansion behind the jet material. Conversely, pressure and density increase near the jet head. Notably, features characteristic of relativistic jets, such as an internal recollimation shock and a robust interaction at the jet head, are also present in case D. It is worth noting that the majority of the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy at this location. Subsequent energy transfer occurs via the instabilities that arise at the jet head and are propagated along its length.

The primary characteristic of the jet in the SS433 system is its precessing motion, leading to speculation about potential disparities in dynamics between stationary and precessing jets. Given our previous research, which considered a conical jet injection with a finite opening angle, we have a theoretical understanding of the hydrodynamics of a non-precessing jet, although our focus was on axisymmetric 2D jets associated with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In this study, we explore a jet linked to an X-ray binary. Despite the significant differences in scale and overall energy between AGN and X-ray binaries, it is widely accepted that their jet dynamics are analogous, with both being launched from the accretion disk around a compact object, such as a black hole, which is fed by its surrounding environment (a galaxy for AGN or a massive companion for XRB).

For non-precessing, continuous jet injections, the interaction between the jet and its surroundings involves four crucial elements: kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy through internal shocks within the jet beam, as well as at the overarching bow shock. The majority of the energy conversion occurs at the bow shock. Inside the shocked Interstellar Medium (ISM), numerous traversing shocks form at the evolving contact surface between the jet and its shocked surroundings, thereby heating the ISM. Additionally, various fluid instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Taylor) emerge around the jet, causing mixing between jet and ISM material.

To begin examining the precessing XRB jet, we compared it directly with a similar, yet three-dimensional static jet. This approach allowed us to identify which mechanisms persist and determine their relative significance.

In accordance with the procedures outlined in section 2.2, we produced four distinct radio maps for scenarios A, B, C, and D. These radio maps are presented in figures 9 and 10. All scenarios have been designed to share a similar precession phase. The radio maps of scenarios A, B, and C, which differ only in the precession angle (set at $10^{\circ}$ for scenario C), are compared with observations to validate the model. Scenario D serves as a representative example of the radio emission for a relativistic standing jet. We have estimated the distance to SS433 as approximately 5.5 kpc. Consequently, we scaled our radio map to correlate the projected arcseconds with the physical distance in parsec. It should be noted that for the simulated radio map, we utilized pressure as a surrogate for the magnetic field. Thus, we can only compare the visual characteristics of the jet features and not their absolute values, such as their intensity. On the right side of figure 9, we plot the intensity contours at 4.80 GHz from Roberts et al. (2008), derived from data collected during March 5-7, 1998. Overlaid is the standard kinematic model assumed for SS433, with plus signs and circles indicating incoming and receding parts, respectively. We have labeled the prominent features that appear in the various figures as I, II, III, and IV. These components, although slightly different due to the tilt towards the line of sight (78 \textsuperscript{∘} with respect to the axis of precession), are present in both the north and south jets. For scenario B, located second from the left in figure 9, only component I is observable. Component V, however, does not appear in simulations A, B, or C, nor in different observations at various frequencies of SS433. In Roberts et al. (2008), the feature is present at 4.80 Ghz, less extended from 1.415 to 1.665GHz and completely absent at 14.94 Ghz. Doolin & Blundell (2009) investigated the possibility that this feature might emit plasma from the circumbinary disk of SS433. Another hypothesis postulates that this feature may be related to backflows at the meeting point of the cocoons inflated by both jets. However, we found no evidence for this in any of our simulated cases.

In historical instances, the jet generates a front (bow) shock that moves ahead for all scenarios. This initial propagation of the front shock matches the supersonic speed of the jet head. By utilizing a Mach number in relation to the ISM sound speed, we found values of M=6 for case A and M=22 for cases B and D. Subsequently, the front shock and jet head may become detached, as the jet head slows down to subsonic velocity, while the jet material remains supersonic. As seen previously, case D exhibits a bullet-like propagation, and no significant detachment is observed during the simulation period. Case A demonstrates detachment at time t=0.5, and case B at time t=0.25. The velocity of the front shock for these two cases reaches vhead=0.05c, which is faster than the ISM sound speed cs,ISM=0.04c. By depicting the sound speed across a 2D section of the domain (figure 7), it is evident that in cases A and B, the sound speed within the cocoon surpasses the ISM sound speed (cs,cocoon>cs,ISM=0.04c). The sound speed in the jet region can exceed 0.1c, while in the SISM region, it is roughly equal to the measured velocity for the front shock. The discontinuity between the cocoon and the ISM travels a short distance in front of the transfer surface established by rhead(t) after it detaches from the front shock. It is worth noting that this transfer surface, or Mach disk in the case of static jets, represents the location where energy conversion from kinetic to thermal occurs. Both the discontinuity and the transfer surface share a comparable velocity, as predicted by simple 1D models of relativistic jets. A similar behavior is also observed in 2D relativistic jets Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012).

Studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations, we notice that in some cases the jets break into filaments due to instabilities (e.g., mo dels P080V18, P100V18, and SNGV18, columns 4, 5, and 6 top panels, and models P100V10, and SNGV10, columns 5 and 6 bottom panels in Figure 3 ). Our simulations show that, in general, filaments form in jets only far from the source ( $\sim$ 30 kpc) unless the collision is strong, i.e, the impact parameter is small (e.g., models P045V18 and P080V18; compare top panels in columns 4 and 6). However, filaments of this form are not frequently seen in radio images of extragalactic jets, which is most likely due to the fact that the jets usually reach lower-pressure regions in the ambient medium and expand substantially before filaments could develop.

The effect of interaction between jets due to turbulence generated by collision can be quantified using the enstrophy density, the mean squared vorticity, $\Omega({\bf r})=\frac{1}{2}\bigl{|}\boldsymbol{\omega}({\bf r})\bigr{|}^{2},$ where $\omega({\bf r})=\nabla\times{\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the vorticity at position ${\bf r}$ (note that, occasionally, it is defined without the 1/2 factor). In Figure 7 we show the integrated enstrophy (over $x$ and $z$ ) as a function of distance from the jet source (the $y$ coordinate) for different impact parameters: P = 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00, 1.3, and $\infty$ in units of the jet diameter. The maximum distance to which the enstrophy shows the jets to propagate as coherent structures increases monotonically as the impact parameter is increased, while the enstrophy peak drops significantly at ${\rm P}>0.5$ , as the jet centers become separated by more than one jet radius.

As the jets propagate, most of the enstrophy (turbulence) is generated near the jet (3rd panel in the first and second columns in Figure 5 ). In the top panel in Figure 7 we show the projected enstrophy, normalized to its value at injection for each model, as a function of the distance along the jet for $y\geq 0$ from the simulations of colliding jets with fixed jet velocities, v \textsubscript{1} = v \textsubscript{2} = 18000 $\rm km\;s^{-1}$ , but with different impact parameters: $0\leq{\rm P}\leq\infty$ (see last row in Table 1 , and P130V18). It can be seen from this figure that more enstrophy is generated right after the collision when we adopt smaller impact parameters. The largest enstrophy peaks ( $>6$ ) belong to the four smallest impact parameters (P = 0, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45).

The bottom panel of Figure 7 shows the maximum of the enstrophy as a function of the impact parameter for interacting jets ( $0\leq{\rm P}\leq 1.3$ ). The enstrophy maximum shows a “phase transition” as a function of the impact parameter at a critical point, ${\rm P_{crit}}\sim 0.5$ . Small impact parameters , $0\leq{\rm P}\lesssim{\rm P_{crit}}$ , result in large enstrophy maxima, $\sim 9$ , in the transition region around ${\rm P_{crit}}$ , the enstrophy drops to about half of this value, and for large impact parameters, ${\rm P_{crit}}\lesssim{\rm P}\leq 1.3$ , the maximum is $\sim 4.6$ . A likely explanation for this “phase transition” is the following. At the collision region of the two jets, the jets slightly oscillate in direction as a result of the growing Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. These oscillations induce a change in the jet gas mass involved directly in the collision by changing the collision cross section. The larger the changes in the mass involved in the collision, the more turbulence is generated driving more shock waves into the ambient medium resulting larger enstrophy maxima. The change in the mass involved in the collision is larger for small impact parameters, generating more turbulence. As we increase the impact parameter, the change in the jet gas mass due to the oscillations of the jets drops at around P $\sim 0.5$ , and, as a consequence, the amount of turbulence and thus the enstrophy maximum are also reduced significantly.

Walg et al. (2013) have advanced the one-dimensional model by considering the influence of the jet beam on the entire surface of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), including the jet head, cocoon, and surface interaction. As a result, the previous equation was revised to $v_{head}=\frac{\sqrt{\eta}}{\sqrt{\eta}+\Omega}v_{b}$, with $\Omega$ now defined as $\sqrt{\frac{A_{ISM}}{A_{j}}}$, where $A_{ISM}$ represents the affected ISM surface and $A_{j}$ denotes the jet head surface. By applying this formula, we derived a value of $\Omega=2$ when the jet's bulk velocity is 0.185c. It's worth mentioning that the higher jet density in case A should not deviate substantially from a bullet-like penetration scenario, where $\Omega=1$.

We illustrate the generation of enstrophy using our simulation with a small impact parameter, P = 0.15, and injection velocities v \textsubscript{1} = v \textsubscript{2} = 18000 $\rm km\;s^{-1}$ . In Figure 8 we show the relative contributions from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd terms in Equation 6 to the enstrophy generation (blue, green and red lines). Note that these terms represent enstrophy generation rates and therefore their dimension is enstrophy over time. For comparison, we also show the enstrophy (black solid line) normalized to its value at the injection (also shown in Figure 7 ). It can be seen clearly from this figure that the compression and the baroclinic terms (2nd and 3rd terms in Equation 6 ) are fluctuating around zero, thus their time integral will be negligible and they do not contribute significantly to the enstrophy. The stretching term (1st term in Equation 6 ) has a shape similar to the of the enstrophy (black solid line). As expected, this term is always positive Buxton & Ganapathisubramani (2010) , and, as a consequence, the contribution from stretching dominates the enstrophy generation. Note, however, that Buxton & Ganapathisubramani (2010) used equations of incompressible fluid dynamics in their analysis, and our simulations were based on compressible fluid dynamics, which is more appropriate for astrophysical applications.

In the analysis, it was observed that the relative intensities of components I, II, III, and IV in our radio maps deviate from those observed. For case A, the components are aligned with the source position, while in cases B and C, they are displaced. This displacement in cases B and C is consistent with the larger precession angle adopted in those cases. The positions of these components are primarily influenced by the jet dynamics, while their intensities are significantly affected by the radiation mechanism. The canonical kinematic model for SS433 was overlaid on the radio maps, but there was a discrepancy between the model position and the actual bright components. This discrepancy increased with distance from the jet source. This is due to the model's failure to account for the increased interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium due to precession and the jet's previous deceleration history. Case A showed a better match to the observations due to its consideration of actual dynamics, while cases B and C showed poor matches, with components escaping or staying too close to the precession axis, respectively. All cases were corrected for Doppler effects. In cases A and C, the Doppler effect was negligible as there was minimal intensity difference between the upper and lower radio components. In case B, however, the upper radio components were significantly brighter than their counterparts in the lower part of the domain, indicative of a higher Lorentz factor. Comparison with the observation showed little difference in intensity between the top and bottom radio components for SS433. Both the discrepancy in distances and symmetry of the radio components suggest that there is no set of parameters for SS433 with a jet speed different from 0.26c. The study by Zavala et al. (2008) used a 10-degree precession angle to reproduce the interaction of SS433 with the supernova remnant W50 at a scale of 20pc. Case C was designed to test whether such an angle could also reproduce the radio observation at a smaller scale. However, as shown, this was not the case. The conclusion is that either there is recollimation of the precessing jet between the two scales, or the angle of precession of SS433 has evolved during its history.

Based on the method outlined in section 2.2, we generated four distinct radio maps for cases A, B, C, and D. These radio maps are depicted in figures 9 and 10. All cases have been designed to share a similar precession phase. Cases A, B, and C, which differ only in the precession angle (set to $10^{\circ}$ for case C), are compared with observations to evaluate the model's accuracy. Case D serves as an illustration of the radio emission in a relativistic standing jet. We have an estimated distance of 5.5 kpc for SS433. Consequently, we scaled our radio map to establish a correlation between the projected arcsec and the physical distance in parsec. It is important to note that for the virtual radio map, we used pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, allowing us to compare the jet features' appearances but not their absolute values, such as their intensity. The right side of figure 9 shows the 4.80 GHz intensity contours from Roberts et al. (2008), derived from data collected during March 5-7, 1998. Overlaid on this is the standard kinematic model for SS433, with plus signs and circles indicating incoming and receding parts, respectively. Individual bright features seen in the different figures are labeled I, II, III, and IV. Despite slight differences due to the tilt towards the line of sight (78 degrees with respect to the precession axis), these components are present in both the north and south jets. In case B, situated second from the left in figure 9, only component I is visible. Component V does not appear in simulations A, B, or C, nor in different observations of SS433 at various frequencies. In Roberts et al. (2008), the feature is present at 4.80 GHz, less extended from 1.415 to 1.665GHz, and entirely absent at 14.94 GHz. Doolin & Blundell (2009) explored the possibility that this feature might be emitting plasma from the circumbinary disk of SS433. Another hypothesis could be that this feature is associated with backflows at the intersection of the cocoons inflated by both jets. However, we failed to find any evidence for this hypothesis in our simulated cases.

In the static-jet case D, a regimen of continuous injection enables the development of stationary shocks along the jet's trajectory. These shocks are a consequence of the jet's re-collimation due to its interaction with the surrounding environment via ram pressure, a finding consistent with axisymmetric investigations. Contrastingly, these re-collimation shocks are scarcely present in precessing jets. Therefore, if we anticipate ram pressure to remain relevant for the collimation of precessing jets, the inertia contrast will likely be the primary mechanism ensuring jet collimation. The inertia at the injection surface is proportional to the jet's density, $\rho_{b}$, which is reliant on the Lorentz factor, as previously discussed. Previous studies suggest that for a constant kinetic jet flux, various inertia and Lorentz factor combinations can be employed, hence, we analyze the impact of $\gamma_{b}$ variation on the collimation of the jet.

In Case D (without precession, and a Lorentz factor of 1.87), the velocity profile exhibits a prominent characteristic: the velocity remains almost steady along the entire jet, before dropping significantly at the jet's head. Upon closer examination of the velocity profile (Figure 6), we observe the development of the initial three standing recollimation shocks at distances 0.02 pc, 0.047 pc, and 0.07 pc. The jet's head advances in line with the Marti 1D model Marti et al. (1997) prediction, without the need for an $\Omega$ correction (as discussed in section 3.1). The jet's body moves at a velocity of $v_{b}=0.845c$, and the head advances at $v_{head}=v_{SISM}=v_{marti}=0.39c$, as suggested by the lower-right panel of Figure 4. This case resembles a scaled-down version of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet. Unlike Case D, both Case B ($v_{marti}=0.39c$) and Case A ($v_{marti}=0.22c$) do not adhere to the same pattern. Instead, Case A (with precession and a Lorentz factor of 1.036) deviates from the trend and decelerates further, as indicated by the change in slope of the depicted $r_{\mathrm{head}}(t)$. The radial velocity profile (top-left panel) demonstrates that the deceleration is not confined to the head, but occurs throughout the jet: closer to the center, the velocity remains constant before gradually decreasing over a considerable distance. The extent of this transition region expands with time: for Case A, it measures 0.03 pc at time $t=0.25$ and 0.045 pc at time $t=1$ (approximately 3.26 years). We attribute this transition region to the SISM region below.

3.1. Bouncing and Merging of Extragalactic Jets

The new data provides quantifiable details about each case. Figure 4 summarizes the findings: the upper portion illustrates the velocity profile at various points in time for cases A, B, and D, with the highest velocity at every radius shown. This velocity profile is denoted as $v_{b}(r)$, representing the maximum velocity detected at a radius $r$ from the source. Notably, this measurement takes into account both jets moving in opposite directions. These velocity profiles offer insights into the internal spatial arrangement of the beam velocity $v_{b}$. The lower part of Figure 4 visualizes the reach of the jet head, contact discontinuity, and front shock over time, using the method explained in section 2.4.

In Figure 5, we implemented the aforementioned method to quantify energy deposition aspects. Two significant issues arise when assessing the energy contents of the distinct regions in our simulations. Initially, we adopted a sharp initial profile in our initial condition, disregarding both the SISM and cocoon, with the jet in direct contact with the undisturbed Interstellar Medium (ISM) at time zero. Consequently, the simulation required a certain period to transition into a more realistic state (estimated for cases A, B, and D at times 0.15, 0.15, and 0.025 units, respectively). Secondly, to maintain the simulation cost-effective, we employed a compact box with open boundaries, enabling the dynamics to permeate the boundaries continuously. This enabled energy to escape the box at later stages of the simulation (estimated for cases A, B, and D at times 1, 1.2, and 0.23 units, respectively). This observation is evident in the energy graphs for cases A and B, where the percentage of excess energy present in the SISM-part of the domain decreases rapidly as the SISM begins to permeate the boundaries, with both jet and cocoon still confined within the domain. These observations complicate our energy measurements at later times. However, we can still deduce conclusions from the overall trend of the energy graphs.

The most apparent conclusion is drawn by comparing cases A and B. In case A, a majority of the injected energy remains within the jet, significantly exceeding both the cocoon and SISM regions. In contrast, case B exhibits the highest energy fraction in the SISM, followed by the cocoon, with only one third of it remaining in the jet region. This dichotomy is a direct consequence of the interaction between the jet and the ISM, influenced by jet precession and its inertia contrast. A significantly higher proportion of energy is transferred from the jet to the ISM as the Lorentz factor (case A: γ = 1.036; case B: γ = 1.87) increases. This serves as further confirmation that case A propagated almost freely in the ISM, while case B initially inflates a hot cocoon before propagating. Both cases A and D (with no precession for case D) demonstrate a substantial proportion of energy remaining within the jet. The two cases differ in the inertia ratio between the jet and the ISM (case A: η = 28.6; case D: η = 0.8). The low energy transfer in case D is due to different reasons: for case A, the high inertia ratio is expected to allow the jet to travel freely despite the extensive surface of interaction due to precession. In contrast, for case D, the inertia ratio should foster more interaction. However, the surface of interaction is minuscule compared to all other cases. Without precession, the $\Omega$ factor correction to the 1D Marti equation (see section 3.1) remains equal to 1. However, where the cocoon region receives almost no energy in case D, nearly 20% of the deposited energy is transferred to the cocoon for case A. If we add this to the contribution to the SISM region, we observe that approximately 40% of the deposited energy is transferred from the jet to the medium for case A, compared to only about 20% for case D. Once again, we see that precession leads to an increased interaction between the jet and its surroundings.

In the radio map of case D, as depicted in figure 10, distinct characteristics associated with relativistic jets are evident. The Doppler effect, resulting from the jet-axis's inclination relative to the observer's line of sight, amplifies emission from the jet moving towards the observer and diminishes emission from the jet moving away. This phenomenon is observable in 3C 296, as detailed by Laing et al. (2006). For statically injected relativistic jets, recollimation shocks are a known phenomenon, forming along the jet's path. Such shocks are hypothesized as sites for particle acceleration within the jet, leading to enhanced brightness, which corresponds to the bright blobs observed in jets like M87 and Cyg A. It should be noted that our simulation did not consider particle acceleration in shocks (as mentioned in section 2.2). Despite this, the radio maps of case D (figure 10) exhibit the emergence of bright spots, suggesting that the compression of the fluid at recollimation shocks may be sufficient for the formation of emission blobs.

In the static-jet case D, a steady injection regime results in the development of standing shocks due to the jet's recollimation as it interacts with its surroundings through ram pressure, a phenomenon observed in axisymmetric investigations. Notably, these recollimation shocks are scarcely present in precessing jets. Given this, it appears that ram pressure may not significantly contribute to the collimation of precessing jets; instead, inertia contrast could be the primary mechanism for maintaining a jet's collimation. The inertia of the jet at the injection surface is contingent upon its density, $\rho_{b}$, which is interrelated with the Lorentz factor, as previously discussed. Due to the potential for different inertia and Lorentz factor combinations to achieve the same kinetic jet flux, we incorporated an examination of the impact of $\gamma_{b}$ variation on the jet's collimation.

In an analysis of the radial velocity profile depicted in figure 4, a three-tiered structure is discernible: an initial flat, undecelerated section close to the source, a middle segment characterized by constant deceleration, and a third region where the deceleration softens, producing an ankle in the radial profile. This ankle is particularly noticeable in case B, with the distance of its occurrence at approximately 0.065 parsecs and the end of the deceleration zone at 0.09 parsecs, where the velocity profile reaches zero. The corresponding radial reach graph for the same case reveals that at time t = 1, the endpoint of the jet beam and the front shock position are both at 0.065 parsecs and 0.09 parsecs, respectively, indicating that this region lies beyond the cocoon, in the SISM region. The non-zero velocity in this region provides direct evidence that the SISM is being mildly accelerated to relativistic speeds, such as 0.03c for case B. Energy is transferred to the SISM region via shocks, as established by Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012). In the case of precessing jets, it is also found that they contribute to the SISM medium's acceleration by imparting kinetic energy to it. This same effect is observable in case A. For case D, however, the Mach disk and the front shock are not clearly distinguishable, hence this feature is absent.

In the context of AGN jets, the inertial ratio between the jet and the surrounding medium, denoted as $\eta$, serves as a significant factor in determining the jet's velocity. This ratio is defined as $\eta=\gamma^{4}\frac{\rho_{b}h_{b}}{\rho_{ISM}h_{ISM}}$ , where $\rho_{b}$ and $h_{b}$ represent the jet's density and enthalpy, respectively, and $\rho_{ISM}$ and $h_{ISM}$ denote the density and enthalpy of the interstellar medium (ISM). The ram pressure, a force exerted on the jet that opposes its progression, is proportional to the product of the ISM density, the jet's Lorentz factor squared, and the square of the jet's velocity, and can be expressed as $F_{ram}\propto-\rho_{ISM}\gamma^{4}v_{b}^{2}$ . In the absence of precession, a higher density ratio typically leads to a more pronounced deceleration, as suggested by Marti et al. (1997) . For a one-dimensional jet, equilibrium between the ram pressure at the jet's head and the jet's kinetic energy yields the equation $v_{head}=\frac{\sqrt{\eta}}{\sqrt{\eta}+1}v_{b}$ , with $v_{head}$ representing the speed of the jet's head, $v_{b}$ the velocity of the material within the jet's beam, and $\eta$ the inertial ratio, as previously defined. In a medium of uniform composition and constant beam flux, this equation results in a consistent velocity for the jet's head. Using the parameters outlined in case A, the theoretical velocity for the jet's head, according to Marti et al. (1997), would be $v_{head}^{marti}=0.22c$ , which exceeds the $v_{head}=0.185c$ we had previously calculated.

In Case D, characterized by a $\gamma$ value of 1.87 and absence of precession, the velocity profile exhibits a consistent velocity along the jet's length, with a sudden drop at the head position. Detailed analysis of the velocity profile (Figure 6) reveals the formation of the initial three standing recollimation shocks at distances of 0.02 pc, 0.047 pc, and 0.07 pc. The jet's head adheres to the Marti 1D model's prediction (Marti et al., 1997) without $\Omega$ correction (as discussed in section 3.1). The jet beam maintains a velocity of 0.845c, while the head propagates at 0.39c, as inferred from the lower-right panel of Figure 4. This case represents a typical underdense relativistic jet, resembling a scaled-down AGN jet. However, this behavior is not observed in cases B and A, where the jet velocities deviate from the Marti velocity (0.39c). In Case A, which includes precession and a $\gamma$ value of 1.036, the trend is different, with an increased deceleration evident from the altered slope of the presented $r_{\mathrm{head}}(t)$ . The radial velocity profile (top-left panel) indicates that the deceleration does not solely occur at the head but spreads across the entire beam, with the velocity remaining constant near the center before gradually decreasing over a considerable distance. The size of this transition region expands with time, measuring 0.03 pc at time t = 0.25 and 0.045 pc at time t = 1 (approximately 3.26 years). We attribute this transition region to the SISM region below.

Objective. Our objective is to delve into the comprehensive three-dimensional dynamics of relativistic jets emanating from active astrophysical objects, such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. Specifically, we are endeavoring to integrate the rotational motion of a jet into a model designed for the X-ray binary SS433's jet. The primary focus of our research lies on the sub-parsec scales of this system. We are examining the consequences of jet precession and the fluctuation of the Lorentz factor of the infused matter on the overall three-dimensional jet dynamics and the energy transmission to the surrounding environment. Upon elucidating and measuring the jet dynamics, our intention is to produce synthetic radio mapping of the data, with the purpose of comparing our findings with observational data.


The initial data obtained from the velocity profile developments (upper section) and radial distances (lower section) pertains to the advancement of the jet head. The lower section readings enable us to extrapolate the progression of the actual head velocity (terminal velocity of the jet) $v_{head}$, the speed of the discontinuity (terminal velocity of the cocoon) $v_{disc}$, and the front shock (terminal velocity of the shocked Interstellar Medium) $v_{SISM}$, as calculated from the depicted $r_{\mathrm{head}}(t)$, $r_{\mathrm{disc}}(t)$, and $r_{\mathrm{SISM}}(t)$ developments. It's crucial to mention that due to their differing dynamics, the lower section figures are presented only up to time $t=0.25$ (0.82 years) for case D and up to time $t=2$ (6.53 years) for both cases A and B.

3.2. Instabilities in Colliding Jets

In the context of AGN jets, the inertial ratio between the jet and the surrounding medium, denoted as $\eta$, plays a significant role in determining the jet's propagation speed. This ratio is determined by the beam density and enthalpy compared to the ISM density and enthalpy, as represented by $\eta=\gamma^{2}\frac{\rho_{b}h_{b}}{\rho_{ISM}h_{ISM}}$ . The ram pressure, which impedes the jet's progress, is proportional to $-\rho_{ISM}\gamma^{2}v_{b}^{2}$ and acts along the axis of propagation. A higher density ratio generally leads to more efficient deceleration, as suggested by Marti et al. (1997) for non-precessing jets. For a 1D jet, the ram pressure equilibrium at the head provides the equation $v_{head}=\frac{\sqrt{\eta}}{\sqrt{\eta}+1}v_{b}$ , where $v_{head}$ is the speed of the jet's head, $v_{b}$ is the velocity of the material in the jet's beam, and $\eta$ is the inertial ratio between the beam. In a uniform medium with constant beam flux, this equation leads to a constant head velocity. Using parameters similar to case A, the theoretical velocity for the jet head predicted by this equation is $v_{head}^{marti}=0.22c$ , which surpasses the previously calculated $v_{head}=0.185c$.

In the study by Monceau-Baroux et al. (2012), the density ratio between the injected jet beam and its surrounding medium (ISM) was held constant, while the jet Lorentz factor, denoted as $\gamma_{b}$, was the variable used to derive other quantities based on the given kinetic energy content. Conversely, in our approach, we have set the value of $\gamma_{b}$ and determined the integrated energy flux over the beam cross-section using the equation:

$L_{kin}=(\gamma_{b}h_{b}-1)\rho_{b}\gamma_{b}\pi r^{2}_{b}v_{b},$ (4)

where $\rho_{b}$, $r_{b}$, $v_{b}$ represent the jet beam density, radius, and velocity, respectively. The enthalpy for a given polytropic index, $\Gamma$, is expressed as $\rho_{b}h_{b}=\rho_{b}+\frac{\Gamma}{\Gamma-1}P_{b}$, with $P_{b}$ set equal to the ISM pressure, $P_{ISM}$, at the injection surface. By utilizing the relativistic hydrodynamic equation of state to determine $\Gamma$, we can calculate $\rho_{b}$. This setup leads to the creation of a cold supersonic jet. Table 2 provides a summary of the imposed and derived parameters, which differ across various cases. The inertia ratio, defined as $\eta=\gamma_{b}^{2}\frac{\rho_{b}h_{b}}{\rho_{ISM}h_{ISM}}$, is used to indicate the disparity of conditions between the jet and its surrounding environment.

In our subsequent investigations, we focused on replicating the radio observations of SS433, a binary system known for its relativistic jets. The map of the standing case D offers some insight into these jets, and we discovered that the jet's hydrodynamic conditions could account for certain observed features, such as the bright radio blobs along the jet's path, which may be due to the jet's matter constricting at the recollimation shocks. We confirmed the SS433 scenario with a Lorentz factor of 1.036 or an injection velocity of 0.26c. Our model, case A, closely mirrors the VLA radio observations of SS433, with the bright radio components appearing at similar distances. However, we emphasize the need to consider interactions with the surrounding medium, as they are not accounted for in the standard kinematic model. Our model, as depicted in Fig. 9, provides a more accurate fit to the VLA data because it takes into account the full 3D dynamics of the jet as it develops its helical structure, which leads to complex interactions with the medium and, consequently, a slowed-down propagation. This finding is consistent with the work of Panferov (2013) , who used an analytical approach to show that the kinematic model must be adjusted for deceleration to fit the observations.

The jets in Figure 5 do not seem to expand where they meet, therefore the jets in our simulations with P = 1 and 1.3 do not actually collide. However, interestingly, comparing the 2nd and 3rd panels (P = 1 and 1.3) in Figure 5 with the last panel (P = $\infty$ ), we notice that the two jets still interact with each other via turbulence, which enhances the instabilities and generates oscillations traveling down the jets.

Studying the images from our hydrodynamic simulations, we notice that in some cases the jets break into filaments due to instabilities (e.g., mo dels P080V18, P100V18, and SNGV18, columns 4, 5, and 6 top panels, and models P100V10, and SNGV10, columns 5 and 6 bottom panels in Figure 3 ). Our simulations show that, in general, filaments form in jets only far from the source ( $\sim$ 30 kpc) unless the collision is strong, i.e, the impact parameter is small (e.g., models P045V18 and P080V18; compare top panels in columns 4 and 6). However, filaments of this form are not frequently seen in radio images of extragalactic jets, which is most likely due to the fact that the jets usually reach lower-pressure regions in the ambient medium and expand substantially before filaments could develop.

3.3. Enstrophy Generation in Colliding Jets


Walg et al. (2013) have enhanced the one-dimensional model by incorporating the entire surface of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) impacted by the jet beam, jet head, and cocoon. The revised equation is expressed as $v_{head}=\frac{\sqrt{\eta}}{\sqrt{\eta}+\Omega}v_{b}$, where $\Omega=\sqrt{\frac{A_{ISM}}{A_{j}}}$ and $A_{ISM}$ represents the surface area of the affected ISM, while $A_{j}$ signifies the surface area of the jet head. In our analysis, we derived a value of $\Omega=2$ when the jet's bulk velocity is 0.185c. It is worth noting that the higher jet density in case A should not deviate significantly from a penetration resembling a bullet, where $\Omega=1$.


The initial data obtained from both the velocity profile developments (upper section) and radial distances (lower section) pertains to the advancement of the jet head. The data from the lower section enables us to deduce the progression of the actual head velocity (terminal velocity of the jet) $v_{head}$, the speed of the discontinuity (terminal velocity of the cocoon) $v_{disc}$, and the front shock (terminal velocity of the shocked Interstellar Medium) $v_{SISM}$, as derived from the presented $r_{\mathrm{head}}(t)$, $r_{\mathrm{disc}}(t)$, and $r_{\mathrm{SISM}}(t)$ developments. It is worth noting that due to differing dynamics, the lower figures are depicted only up to time $t=0.25$ (0.82 years) for case D and up to time $t=2$ (6.53 years) for both cases, A and B.

In the present study, we have derived two principal sets of findings. The first investigates the intricate hydrodynamic phenomena at play. Our research reveals that the precession of a jet and its Lorentz factor significantly impact the jet's interactions with its environment, thereby influencing the energy exchange between the jet and the surrounding medium. The second body of findings revolves around the analysis of radio maps generated from our simulation scenarios. These findings indicate a correlation between the specific parameters utilized in our simulations and the VLA observations of SS433, providing a potential match.

For the current study, we employed a three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model, utilizing the relativistic version of the Euler equations coupled with the Mathews approximation to the Synge gas relation as a closure. The computations were executed on a 3D Cartesian grid, encompassing a volume of $0.2\times 0.1\times 0.1\,\,{\mathrm{pc}^{3}}$, with open boundary conditions applied on all sides. A time-varying bipolar jet was introduced from the model's center, with an inner spherical region serving as the boundary zone, in which all variables were fully prescribed within a sphere of radius 0.008 pc at each time step. It is noteworthy that the source itself is excluded from the simulation for the purpose of radio mapping, as will be elaborated upon subsequently. Our discussion will cover the numerical methodologies for both the gas dynamics and radio mapping components, as well as the initialization and analysis of the simulations in detail.

We illustrate the generation of enstrophy using our simulation with a small impact parameter, P = 0.15, and injection velocities v \textsubscript{1} = v \textsubscript{2} = 18000 $\rm km\;s^{-1}$ . In Figure 8 we show the relative contributions from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd terms in Equation 6 to the enstrophy generation (blue, green and red lines). Note that these terms represent enstrophy generation rates and therefore their dimension is enstrophy over time. For comparison, we also show the enstrophy (black solid line) normalized to its value at the injection (also shown in Figure 7 ). It can be seen clearly from this figure that the compression and the baroclinic terms (2nd and 3rd terms in Equation 6 ) are fluctuating around zero, thus their time integral will be negligible and they do not contribute significantly to the enstrophy. The stretching term (1st term in Equation 6 ) has a shape similar to the of the enstrophy (black solid line). As expected, this term is always positive Buxton & Ganapathisubramani (2010) , and, as a consequence, the contribution from stretching dominates the enstrophy generation. Note, however, that Buxton & Ganapathisubramani (2010) used equations of incompressible fluid dynamics in their analysis, and our simulations were based on compressible fluid dynamics, which is more appropriate for astrophysical applications.

3.4. Applications to 3C 75

The two bipolar jet system in 3C 75 is located in the dumbbell shaped twin Wide Angle Tail (WAT) radio galaxy NGC 1128 at the center of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 400 at a redshift of 0.023 Owen et al. (1985) . Hudson et al. (2006) concluded that the AGNs in 3C 75 form a bound system originating from a previous merger, and they are both contained in a low entropy core moving through the intracluster medium at a relative speed of 1200 km/sec. In Figure 1 the radio and optical (SDSS) images of 3C 75 are shown with green and red colors Hardcastle & Sakelliou (2004) . The two AGNs, the sources of the jets, at the center of the image, are located at about 7 kpc from each other in projection.

SS433, initially observed in star surveys to exhibit H $\alpha$ emission in 1977 (Stephenson & Sanduleak, 1977), is a unique astronomical system. The emission in this system is Doppler-shifted with respect to the position where H $\alpha$ emission is typically emitted in static material, accounting for the Galactic rotation. The emission line for SS433 is tripartite: one shifted towards the red, one towards the blue, and a third one remaining stationary. This observation suggests a static object with two outflows: one directed towards the observer, and one moving away. This peculiar characteristic is almost universally present in objects associated with jets. However, what sets SS433 apart is that the shift is not static but rather evolving over time. Two years following its discovery, numerous studies (Fabian & Rees, 1979) began investigating the periodic variation of its intensity. The first evidence of periodicity was the 164-day variability. This was attributed to the changing position of the outflow over time, thereby establishing the fact that SS433 features precessing bipolar jets. An initial estimation of the jet lower velocity was calculated (Fabian & Rees, 1979), revealing it to be relativistic and exceeding 0.2 times the speed of light ($c$). Subsequent emission line observations of SS433 refined the velocity for the material of the beam to approximately 0.26 times $c$ and its period to 162 days (Milgrom et al., 1982). These observational data led to the kinematic canonical model for SS433: the jet precesses with a period of 162 days with a 20-degree precession axis, itself inclined by 78 degrees from the line of sight (see fig. 1). This kinematic model assumes a constant relativistic jet propagation speed. In reality, AGN jet simulations often compare propagation speeds using a 1D approximation based on ram pressure arguments, differentiating the jet beam from the jet head advance properties. Furthermore, for a given kinetic luminosity and jet head propagation speed, the density and beam velocity are interchangeable within this model. By varying the free parameters for SS4333, we aimed to investigate how the jet deceleration varies with them.

Findings. The synthetic radio map aligns most closely with a jet model that employs the conventional propagation speed of $0.26c$ and a precession angle of $20^{\circ}$. We observe that densely precessing jets endure substantial deceleration as they traverse the interstellar medium (ISM). The overall jet demonstrates a helical configuration. Our data suggests that the kinematics model for SS433 requires amendments to account for deceleration on a subparsec scale, assuming a ballistic propagation pattern.

In our study, we have discovered that precessing jets transfer energy more efficiently than stationary jets, given similar parameters. This enhanced energy transfer is attributed to the larger effective interaction area in precessing jets. Through the creation of synthetic radio maps, we have visualized all the jets, revealing that distinct dynamic flow features are closely associated with regions exhibiting increased emission.

4. Conclusion

We carried out hydrodynamical simulations to study extragalactic jet collisions. We found that colliding jets can be cast into two categories: bouncing and merging jets. We have shown that two fast jets colliding with non-zero impact parameter bounce off each other keeping their identities, but jets with very different velocities colliding with a small impact parameter merge into one jet, and the faster jet takes over the slower jet. We have found that the collision enhances the instabilities of the jets; kpc scale oscillations are generated, and the jets may break up into filaments. In some projections, the filaments may show a twisted structure.

Project objectives entail investigating temporal fluctuations in the jet flux by drawing nearer to the origin. A secondary objective is to replicate the time-dependent VLBA observations, where visual evidence of blobs ejecting from the source is documented.

Our hydrodynamical simulations suggest a physical explanation for the twisted radio morphology of 3C 75: strong instabilities are generated in the faster jet by the collision with a much slower jet with a small, but finite impact parameter. We leave a more quantitative analysis of 3C 75 for a future study.
