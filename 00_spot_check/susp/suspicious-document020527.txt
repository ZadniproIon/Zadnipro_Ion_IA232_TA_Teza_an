Sharp Strichartz estimates in spherical coordinates

By Robert Schippa

Abstract

The Strichartz estimates we have successfully established for both the wave and Dirac equations are compiled in the following theorem, as outlined in reference [2].

1. Introduction

Since we consider homogeneous estimates, we shall confine ourselves to homogeneous equations: 
 
 (1)  $\left\{\begin{array}[]{cl}i\partial_{t}u(t,x)+\varphi(D)u(t,x)&=0,\,(t,x)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{n},D=(-\Delta)^{1/2},\\
u(0,\cdot)&=u_{0}.\end{array}\right.$ 
 In the following we will deal with Schrödinger-like equations for most of the time, that is the dispersion relation $\varphi\in C^{\infty}((0,\infty),\mathbb{R})$ is given by 
 
 (2)  $\varphi(\rho)=\rho^{a},\;a>1.$ 
 Strichartz estimates capture the dispersive properties of solutions to linear dispersive equations and classical homogeneous estimates for ( 1 ) in the case of ( 2 ) state as follows 
 
 (3)  $\|u\|_{L_{t}^{q}L_{x}^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})}\lesssim_{a,n,p,q}\|u_{0}\|_{\dot{H}^{s}},$ 
 where the derivatives are determined by scaling 
 
 (4)  $s=n\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)-\frac{a}{q}.$ 
 Keel and Tao proved the sharp range of homogeneous estimates in [TaoKeel1998] , which is given by 
 
 (5)  $\frac{1}{q}\leq\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right),\;q,p\geq 2,\;p\neq\infty.$ 
 Making use of the bilinear interpolation argument worked out in [TaoKeel1998] , Cho, Ozawa and Xia showed homogeneous estimates for more general dispersion relations in [ChoOzawaXia2011, Theorem 2, p. 1123] . 
 Sharpness of ( 5 ) is seen considering a Knapp-type example, that is a maximally anisotropic propagating wave. This example was already considered by Strichartz in his seminal paper [Strichartz1977, Lemma 3., p. 707] , in which he linked special cases of estimates of the kind ( 3 ) to Fourier restriction estimates through duality. We review a modified example in Proposition 1 . 
 This raised the question, whether one can extend the range of integrability coefficients found in [TaoKeel1998] and [ChoOzawaXia2011] if one punishes anisotropic propagation by considering angular regularity of the initial data. More precisely, for equations ( 1 ) in the case of ( 2 ) we want to consider estimates of the kind: 
 
 (6)  $\|u\|_{L_{t}^{q}L_{x}^{p}}\lesssim_{a,n,p,q,\alpha}\|u_{0}\|_{\dot{H}^{s,\alpha}_{\omega}},$ 
 where the Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^{s,\alpha}_{\omega}=D^{-s}\Lambda_{\omega}^{-\alpha}L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ with angular regularity $\alpha$ are defined making use of the inhomogeneous Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Lambda_{\omega}=(1-\Delta_{\omega})^{1/2}$ , when 
 
 $\Delta_{\omega}=\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n}\Omega_{ij}^{2},\;\Omega_{ij}=x_{i}\partial_{j}-x_{j}\partial_{i}.$ 
 This is in fact the case and Cho and Lee found the following theorem to hold:

Let $n\geq 2$ and suppose that $(q,p)$ satisfies 
 
 (7)  $\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)<\frac{1}{q}\leq\frac{2n-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right),\;q,p\geq 2,$ 
 $(n,q,p)\neq(2,2,\infty)\mbox{ and }(q,p)\neq(2,(4n-2)/(2n-3))$ . 
 Then we find the estimate ( 6 ) to hold for the solution $u$ to ( 1 ) with $s$ from ( 4 ) provided that $\alpha>((2n-1)/(2n-2))(2/q+n/p-n/2)$ .

The distinction between the assumptions on $V$ in Theorems 2.3 and 3.2 is notable: while Theorem 2.3 relies on the structural hypothesis (2.5), Theorem 3.2 employs (3.12) to establish a necessary level of minimal angular regularity.

Suppose that $n\geq 2$ and $(q,p)$ satisfies ( 7 ). Then we find that $\alpha\geq\frac{2}{q}+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{2}$ is necessary for estimate ( 6 ) to hold.

Making use of a result due to Guo from [Guo2014] we prove the following result establishing estimates of the kind ( 6 ) for Schrödinger-like equations with sharp angular regularity up to endpoints:

Let $q,p\geq 2$ , suppose that we are in the case of ( 2 ) and 
 
 $\begin{split}&\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)<\frac{1}{q}<\frac{2n-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)\mbox{ for }n=2,\\
&\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)<\frac{1}{q}\leq\frac{2n-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right),\;(q,p)\neq\left(2,\frac{4n-2}{2n-3}\right)\mbox{ for }n>2.\end{split}$ 
 Then, for $n=2$ or $n>2$ and $q=2$ , we find the estimate ( 6 ) to hold for $\alpha>\frac{2}{q}+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{2}$ and for $n>2$ we find the estimate ( 6 ) to hold for $\alpha=\frac{2}{q}+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{2}$ , whenever $q\neq 2$ .

2. Proof of Proposition 1 and Theorem 1.2

First, we show the necessary angular regularity:

To begin with, consider the free homogeneous case. Notably, property (1.2) implies $\mathcal{D}^{2}=-I_{4}\Delta$, leading to

\[
(1.3) \quad (i\partial_{t}-\mathcal{D})(i\partial_{t}+\mathcal{D})u=-\square u,
\]

which indicates that every solution to the free Dirac equation satisfies a vectorial wave equation with appropriate initial conditions. Although $\mathcal{D}$ possesses a complex structure, leveraging the well-established theory for the free wave equation allows us to express the Dirac linear propagator as

\[
(1.4) \quad e^{it\mathcal{D}}f=\cos(t|D|)f+i\frac{\sin(t|D|)}{|D|}\mathcal{D}f,
\]

along with the Strichartz estimates

\[
(1.5) \quad \|e^{it\mathcal{D}}f\|_{L^{p}_{t}\dot{H}_{q}^{\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{2}}}\lesssim\|f\|_{L^{2}},
\]

valid for all pairs $(p,q)$ satisfying

\[
\frac{2}{p}+\frac{2}{q}=1,\quad 2\leq p\leq\infty,\qquad\infty>q\geq 2.
\]

These estimates convey two distinct pieces of information: locally in time, they reflect a smoothing effect, indicating an improvement in integrability relative to a suitable norm. Conversely, globally in time, they describe a decay effect, meaning that the spatial norm of a solution diminishes to zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$, at least in an $L^{p}$ time-averaged sense.

Selecting the pair $(p,q)=(2,\infty)$ produces the endpoint estimate

\[
(1.6) \quad \|e^{it\mathcal{D}}f\|_{L^{2}_{t}L^{\infty}_{x}}\lesssim\|f\|_{\dot{H}^{1}},
\]

which is known to fail, akin to its counterpart for the 3D wave flow (see [8]). If (1.6) were valid, one could establish global well-posedness for problem (1.1) (at least for $V=0$) using standard techniques. By examining the solution map

\[
v\mapsto\Phi(v)=e^{it\mathcal{D}}f+i\int_{0}^{t}e^{i(t-t^{\prime})\mathcal{D}}P_{3}(v(t^{\prime}))dt^{\prime},
\]

one would derive

\[
\left\|\int_{0}^{t}e^{i(t-t^{\prime})\mathcal{D}}v(t^{\prime})^{3}dt\right\|_{L^{2}L^{\infty}}\lesssim\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\|e^{it\mathcal{D}}e^{-it^{\prime}\mathcal{D}}P_{3}(v(t^{\prime}))\|_{L^{2}L^{\infty}}dt^{\prime}\lesssim\|v^{3}\|_{L^{1}H^{1}},
\]

which, combined with the conservation of the $H^{1}$ norm, would yield

\[
\|\Phi(v)\|_{L^{\infty}_{t}H^{1}_{x}}+\|\Phi(v)\|_{L^{2}_{t}L^{\infty}_{x}}\lesssim\|f\|_{H^{1}}+\|v\|_{L^{\infty}H^{1}}\|v\|_{L^{2}L^{\infty}}^{2}.
\]

In other words, a contraction argument in the norm $\|\cdot\|_{L^{2}L^{\infty}}+\|\cdot\|_{L^{\infty}H^{1}}$ would suffice to demonstrate the global existence of small $H^{1}$ solutions to (1.1).

It is essential to observe that our analysis necessitates an angular regularity parameter $s>1$ for the data under consideration, which represents a stronger condition than the $s>0$ assumption employed in the prior work detailed in [9]. While it is feasible to reduce our requirements to $s>0$, doing so would introduce the need for an additional analytical tool: a Moser-type product estimate of the form 

$$\|\Lambda^{s}_{\omega}(uv)\|_{L^{2}_{\omega}}\lesssim\|u\|_{L^{\infty}_{\omega}}\|\Lambda^{s}_{\omega}v\|_{L^{2}_{\omega}}+\|\Lambda^{s}_{\omega}u\|_{L^{2}_{\omega}}\|v\|_{L^{\infty}_{\omega}},\qquad s>0,$$

and a corresponding estimate for $\Lambda^{s}_{\omega}|D|(uv)$. Deriving such estimates would involve extensive calculations on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{2}$, which we have elected to avoid in favor of leveraging the more straightforward algebraic properties inherent to the space $H^{s}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$ when $s>\frac{n-1}{2}$.

Let $a>1,\;q,p\geq 2$ and suppose that 
 
 $\begin{split}&\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)<\frac{1}{q}<\frac{2n-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)\mbox{ for }n=2,\\
&\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)<\frac{1}{q}\leq\frac{2n-1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right),\;(q,p)\neq\left(2,\frac{4n-2}{2n-3}\right)\mbox{ for }n>2.\end{split}$ 
 Then we find the estimate 
 
 (16)  $\left\|P_{N}e^{itD^{a}}u_{0}\right\|_{L_{t}^{q}\mathcal{L}_{r}^{p}L_{\omega}^{2}}\lesssim_{n,p,q}N^{s}\|u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}$ 
 to hold for any $N\in 2^{\mathbb{Z}}$ with $s=\frac{n}{2}-\frac{n}{p}-\frac{a}{q}$ .

Theorem 1.2 is a consequence:

For $(q,p)$ admissible for Theorem 2.1 and $\alpha=(n-1)\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)$ we find 
 
 $\begin{split}\|P_{N}u\|_{L_{t}^{q}L_{x}^{p}}&\lesssim_{n,p}\|\Lambda_{\omega}^{\alpha}P_{N}u\|_{L_{t}^{q}\mathcal{L}_{r}^{p}L_{\omega}^{2}}\\
&\lesssim_{n,p,q}N^{s}\|\Lambda_{\omega}^{\alpha}P_{N}u_{0}\|_{L^{2}}\end{split}$ 
 Taking $p$ to the sharp line, we find for $q>2$ 
 
 $\alpha=(n-1)\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{p}\right)=\frac{2}{q}+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{2}.$ 
 For $q=2$ we only find 
 
 $\alpha>\frac{2}{q}+\frac{n}{p}-\frac{n}{2}\mbox{ as }p\rightarrow\frac{4n-2}{2n-3}.$ 
 The frequency localization is removed employing Littlewood-Paley theory and the proof is concluded interpolating with the estimates on the classical sharp line. ∎

3. Remarks

In the course of establishing our proof, we have inadvertently derived endpoint estimates for the wave flow that exhibit a gain in angular regularity, specifically:

\[
(3.9) \quad n \geq 3, \qquad \|e^{it|D|}f\|_{L^{2}_{t}L^{\infty}_{r}L^{2}_{\omega}} \lesssim \|\Lambda^{\sigma_{n}}_{\omega}f\|_{\dot{H}^{\frac{n-1}{2}}}
\]

Here, $\sigma_{n}$ corresponds to the value defined in (3.4). While this outcome was not the primary focus of our investigation, it is worthwhile to contrast (3.9) with existing literature. For the three-dimensional case ($n=3$), the estimate aligns with Theorem 1.1-III in [9], where $\sigma_{3} = -\frac{3}{4}$ is established; however, whether this value represents the optimal threshold remains unresolved. Notably, the same study demonstrates that the inequality fails for $\sigma_{3} < -\frac{5}{6}$. For dimensions $n \geq 4$, the estimate (3.9) appears to be novel, as does (3.6) for $n \geq 3$. A comprehensive discussion of related estimates can be found in [6] and the references cited therein.
