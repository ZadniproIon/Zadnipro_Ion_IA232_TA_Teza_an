Quest for HI Turbulence Statistics: New Techniques

By A. Lazarian and D. Pogosyan and Alejandro Esquivel

Abstract

Emission in spectral lines offers unique insights into interstellar turbulence. Doppler shifts caused by supersonic motions provide information about the turbulent velocity field, which is otherwise challenging to measure. However, separating velocity and density fluctuations remains a significant challenge. Using atomic hydrogen (HI) as a case study, this work reviews techniques applicable to emission line analysis, focusing on those that can reveal the underlying power spectra of velocity and density. Recent mathematical advancements show promise in addressing this challenge, and their application to HI data reveals that velocity fluctuations dominate small-scale structures observed in spectral-line data cubes. This finding is crucial for interpreting observational data, including cloud identification. The results suggest that velocity fluctuations may be mistakenly identified as diffuse clouds. While HI data aligns with the Goldreich-Shridhar model of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, the cascade from several-kpc scales does not fit well within the current energy injection paradigm. The question of whether magnetic fields induce anisotropy in turbulence remains unresolved, but if true, emission line studies could reliably determine magnetic field directions. Various techniques for studying interstellar turbulence using emission lines are discussed, including spectral correlation functions, genus statistics, and principal component analysis.

1. Introduction

Atomic hydrogen is a critical constituent of the interstellar medium, with extensive research dedicated to its study (see Burton 1992). In the context of turbulence research, it offers several significant advantages. One key benefit is the ability to generally neglect self-absorption when analyzing HI. This is supported by two primary factors: self-absorption effects are minimal (Braun 1997, Higgs 1999), and as demonstrated in Lazarian (1995, hereafter L95), localized absorption features typical of HI have only a minor impact on large-scale statistics. Additionally, the widespread distribution of neutral hydrogen contrasts sharply with the localized nature of molecular species, thereby reducing challenges associated with averaging. Furthermore, the emissivity of atomic hydrogen being directly proportional to the density of atomic hydrogen simplifies analytical processes.

Statistical analysis plays a pivotal role in studying turbulence, offering a significant advantage by isolating the fundamental patterns of fluid motion while discarding transient specifics. The application of statistical methods to interstellar turbulence traces its origins to the mid-20th century, with foundational work conducted by Horner (1951), Kampe de Feriet (1955), Munch (1958), and Wilson et al. (1959). Subsequent research in this domain has yielded varied outcomes, as evidenced by comprehensive reviews by Kaplan & Pickelner (1970), Dickman (1985), Lazarian (1992), and Armstrong, Rickett & Spangler (1995). Notably, studies focusing on turbulence statistics in ionized environments have been particularly fruitful, revealing critical insights into the statistical distribution of plasma density across scales ranging from $10^{8}$ to $10^{15}$ cm. This progress has been significantly bolstered by advancements in understanding scintillation and scattering processes, as detailed by Goodman & Narayan (1985) and Narayan & Goodman (1989). However, the technique remains constrained by the paucity of sampling directions and the challenges associated with obtaining velocity data.

Statistical analyses of interstellar turbulence using emission lines can offer insights into turbulence characteristics across different phases of the interstellar medium, such as neutral gas. Moreover, velocity data enables the differentiation between static structures and turbulent dynamics.

Theoretically, turbulence studies utilizing emission lines have faced significant challenges, primarily due to shortcomings in descriptive frameworks. For example, notable statistical analyses of molecular clouds (Dickman 1985, Dickman & Kleiner 1985, Miesch & Bally 1994) have not attained the level of success observed in analogous investigations through scintillation methods.

Interstellar turbulence remains a poorly understood phenomenon despite numerous efforts to investigate it. While significant advancements have been made in numerical research (as detailed in Ostriker 1999 and Vazquez-Semadeni & Passot 1999), current computational methods are insufficient to replicate flows that match the observed complexity and Reynolds numbers, and this limitation is unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future. As a result, only direct observational studies of interstellar turbulence can yield the essential insights needed to unravel this enigma. To address this challenge, it is crucial to determine the statistical properties of density, velocity, and magnetic field distributions. In this review, I provide an overview of the information that emission lines can offer. I would like to reference Alyssa Goodman, who has noted that modern technology has made spectral-line mapping of extensive regions of the interstellar medium "a booming cottage industry." However, attempts to utilize this vast observational dataset through visual examination alone have proven ineffective, necessitating the development of more advanced analytical techniques.

2. Statistics of HI Data Cubes and Velocity Channel Analysis

Doppler shifted spectral lines carry information about turbulent velocity, but until very recently there was no way of extracting this information. The problem is that both velocity and density fluctuations contribute to the fluctuations of the intensity at a given velocity. In other words: We know the statistics of spectral lines, i.e. the statistics in velocity space, while we want to determine the actual 3D statistics.

For the purpose of simplifying the analysis, it is assumed that both the density correlation function and the velocity correlation tensor exhibit isotropy within the Galactic coordinate system (spanning the $xyz$ spatial dimensions). This assumption implies that the density field satisfies the condition $\langle\rho({\bf x})\rho({\bf x}+{\bf r})\rangle = \xi(r) = \xi({\bf r})$, thereby reflecting a spatially homogeneous and isotropic correlation structure.

A quantitative analysis of the effects of space-velocity mapping is presented in Lazarian & Pogosyan (1999; hereafter LP99). In their formulation, the observed velocity of a gas element, ${\bf v}^{obs}$, is expressed as the sum of a regular component ${\bf v}^{reg}$ (e.g., due to Galactic rotation) and a turbulent component ${\bf u}$, such that ${\bf v}^{obs} = {\bf v}^{reg} + {\bf u}$. The transformation from real space to PPV coordinates is given by

\[
{\bf X_{s}} = {\bf X}, \quad z_{s} = A\left[f^{-1}z - {\bf u}({\bf x}) \cdot {\bf\hat{z}}\right],
\]

where ${\bf X_{s}}$ and $z_{s}$ represent position-position and velocity coordinates, respectively. The parameter $A$ is a unit conversion factor and does not affect the final turbulence statistics. The shear parameter $f = \left(\delta v_{z}^{reg}/\delta z\right)^{-1}$ is critical to the mapping process and influences the results. For Galactic disc studies, $A = f$ is typically chosen, whereas isolated cloud studies correspond to $f^{-1} \to 0$. Given the focus on Galactic disc HI in previous work, we adopt the former convention.

Using this space-velocity mapping, LP99 derive the power spectrum $P_{s}$ in PPV space:

\[
\langle\rho_{s}({\bf k})\rho_{s}^{*}({\bf k^{\prime}})\rangle = P_{s}({\bf k})\delta({\bf k - k^{\prime}}),
\]

where

\[
P_{s}({\bf k}) = e^{-f^{2}k_{z}^{2}v_{T}^{2}}\int d^{3}{\bf r}\,e^{i{\bf k}\cdot{\bf r}}\Xi({\bf k},{\bf r}),
\]

and

\[
\Xi({\bf k},{\bf r}) = \langle e^{ifk_{z}(u_{z}({\bf x}) - u_{z}({\bf x\prime}))}\rho({\bf x})\rho({\bf x\prime})\rangle.
\]

The derivation assumes statistical homogeneity in real space, with the averaging operation depending only on the separation vector ${\bf r} = {\bf x} - {\bf x\prime}$. The uncorrelated nature of density Fourier modes in PPV space is reflected in the delta function. The factor $e^{-f^{2}k_{z}^{2}v_{T}^{2}}$, involving the thermal velocity $v_{T}$, arises from thermal averaging and indicates that only supersonic motions are accessible for statistical analysis. Notably, similar expressions have been derived in studies of large-scale structure (e.g., Scoccimarro et al. 1999), underscoring the conceptual overlap between these fields. However, the treatment of "redshift-space" distortions in galaxy statistics (e.g., Kaiser 1987) has primarily focused on linear perturbations or cases where velocity contributions can be factorized, unlike the more complex, nonlinear density fields encountered in turbulence studies.

A quantitative analysis of the effects of space-velocity mapping is presented in Lazarian & Pogosyan (1999, hereafter LP99). In their model, the velocity of a gas element is expressed as the sum of a regular component **v**^reg, which may result from processes such as Galactic rotation, and a turbulent, stochastic component **u**, such that **v**^obs = **v**^reg + **u**. The transformation from real space to PPV coordinates is described as a mapping process.

The expression for the 3D spectrum in PPV space is given by $P_{s}({\bf k})=e^{-f^{2}k_{z}^{2}v_{T}^{2}/2}\int d^{3}{\bf r}\,e^{i{\bf k}\cdot{\bf r}}\xi(r)\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}f^{2}k_{z}^{2}D_{z}({\bf r})\right],$ where $D_{z}({\bf r})$ represents the projection of the structure tensor onto the $z$-axis. This general formulation, as seen in Eq. (7), is versatile and enables the connection of arbitrary velocity and density statistics in galactic coordinates to the HI emissivity in PPV space.

Velocity and density power spectra can be derived from observed emissivities. Velocity fluctuations cause emissivity spectra in velocity slices to exhibit shallower slopes, which can result in the misinterpretation of small-scale structures in PPV space as interstellar clouds or clumps.

The relative dominance of \( P_{2v} \) and \( P_{2\rho} \) hinges on whether \( n > -3 - \frac{m}{2} \) or \( n < -3 - \frac{m}{2} \). When \( n > -3 - \frac{m}{2} \), \( P_{2\rho} \) is the dominant term. However, for \( n < -3 - \frac{m}{2} \), \( P_{2\rho} \) becomes significant only in the case of very thick slices, where a substantial portion of the line is integrated. This is because integration across the line width retains only density-related information. In intermediate scenarios, if the density spectrum has a steep profile (i.e., \( n < -3 - \frac{m}{2} \)), \( P_{2v} \) predominantly contributes to \( P_{2} \).

Our results are summarized in Table 1.

It is easy to see that both in cases (a) and (b) the power law index gradually steepens with the increase of velocity slice thickness. In the thickest velocity slices the velocity information is averaged out and it is natural that we get the density spectral index $n$ . The velocity fluctuations dominate in thin slices, and if the 3-D velocity power spectrum is $P_{v}\sim k^{-3-m}$ , then the index $m$ can be found from thin slices (see Table 1). Note, that the notion of thin and thick slices depends on a turbulence scale under study and the same slice can be thick for small scale turbulent fluctuations and thin for large scale ones. The formal criterion for the slice to be thick is that the dispertion of turbulent velocities on the scale studied should be less than the velocity slice thickness . Otherwise the slice is thin .

Predictions of LP00 were tested in Lazarian et al. (2001) using numerical MHD simulations of compressible intersterllar gas. Simulated data cubes allowed both density and velocity statistics to be measured directly. Then these data cubes were used to produce synthetic spectra which were analysed using the VCA. As the result, the velocity and density statistics were successfully recovered. Thus one can confidently apply the technique to HI observations. Note, that the VCA is only sensitive to velocity \footnote{ 1 For Kolmogorov turbulence the velocity gradient scales as $l^{-2/3}$ .} and density gradients on the scale under study, so the regular Galactic rotation curve or large scale distribution of emitting gas does not interfere with the analysis.

Further research in Lazarian & Pogosyan (2002) incorporated the effects of absorption into the VCA. Namely, we have shown that in the presence of strong absorption a universal spectrum with index $-3$ is being produced in very thick slices, provided that the density is steep. The universality means that the emissivity spectral index does not depend on the underlying statistics of velocity and density. For shallow density, its spectral index determines the emissivity statistics. To get velocity information thin slices must be used.

3. Applications of the VCA: SMC and Galactic HI

In Figure 1, the range of turbulence scales addressed in Green's study is depicted. The minimum $|\bf K|$ values extend from approximately $1/3$ pc \textsuperscript{-1} in the nearest slices to $1/200$ pc \textsuperscript{-1} in the farthest ones. It is evident that the majority of the measurements fall within the thin slice regime.

One of the most comprehensive studies of 21 cm statistics was conducted by Green (1993). His observations of HI emission were carried out using the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) Synthesis Telescope, targeting the region $l=140^{\circ},b=0^{\circ}$ ( $03^{h}03^{m}23^{s},+58^{\circ}06^{\prime}20^{\prime}$ , epoch 1950.0). These observations revealed a power law spectrum of 2D intensity, proportional to $P_{2}({\bf K})|_{\cal L}$, whose interpretation hinges on whether the slicing technique employed is thick or thin. To address this, the dispersion of turbulent velocity at the relevant scales must be estimated and compared to the velocity thickness of the slice (see equations (13) and (14)). Assuming velocity variations of $10$ km/s at a scale of $30$ pc, which are attributed to Kolmogorov turbulence, the velocity structure functions are expressed as:

$D_{LL}(r)\approx 100\left(\frac{r}{30{\rm pc}}\right)^{2/3}~{}{\rm km}^{2}{\rm s}^{-2}~{}~{}~{},$  (15)

The width of the interferometer channels in Green’s dataset, which combines to form a single data point, is $\delta V=5.94~{}\mathrm{km/s}$. The slice thickness in parsecs is given by ${\cal L}\approx\delta Vf$ pc, ranging from approximately $600$ pc for the nearest slices to $2200$ pc for the more distant ones. A note indicates that the thermal velocity cutoff (as described in section 2.1) in the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) is $\sim 6$ km/s. If the WNM dominates the neutral phase, the velocity resolution used is optimal, and further reductions in $\delta V$ would not yield additional information. However, if the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) constitutes a significant fraction of the mass near the Galactic plane, a higher velocity resolution of up to $1$ km/s would be beneficial. The wavenumber marking the transition from thin to thick slicing, as per equation (14), is $0.16\,pc^{-1}$.

One of the most comprehensive studies of 21 cm statistics was conducted by Green (1993). Using the Synthesis Telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), he observed HI emission toward $l=140^{\circ},b=0^{\circ}$ ($03^{h}03^{m}23^{s},+58^{\circ}06^{\prime}20^{\prime}$, epoch 1950.0). His observations uncovered a power-law spectrum of 2D intensity, proportional to $P_{2}({\bf K})|_{\cal L}$. The interpretation of this spectrum hinges on whether the slicing technique is thick or thin. To address this, one must estimate the turbulent velocity dispersion at the relevant scales and compare it to the velocity thickness of the slice (see equations 13 and 14). Assuming velocity variations of $10$ km/s at a scale of $30$ pc, attributed to Kolmogorov turbulence, the velocity structure function is $D_{LL}(r)\approx 100\left(\frac{r}{30{\rm pc}}\right)^{2/3}~{}{\rm km}^{2}{\rm s}^{-2}$. The interferometer channel width in Green’s dataset is $\delta V=5.94~{}\mathrm{km/s}$, resulting in a slice thickness of ${\cal L}\approx\delta Vf$ pc, which ranges from approximately $600$ pc for nearby slices to $2200$ pc for distant ones. A note highlights that the thermal velocity cut-off in the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) is $\sim 6$ km/s, as detailed in Draine & Lazarian (1999). If the WNM dominates the neutral phase, as suggested by Dickey (1995), the velocity resolution used is optimal, and further reductions in $\delta V$ would not yield additional information. However, if the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) is significant near the Galactic plane, a higher velocity resolution of up to $1$ km/s would be preferable. The transition wavenumber from thin to thick slicing, as given by equation 14, is $0.16\,pc^{-1}$.

The dominance of either $P_{2v}$ or $P_{2\rho}$ in the observed emissivity spectra within the thin slice regime hinges on the value of the density spectral index $n$. When $n > -3$, $P_{2\rho}$ becomes the dominant term, and the emissivity spectrum observed by Green (1993) exhibits an index of $n + m/2$. Notably, for $m = 2/3$, this corresponds to a spectral index of approximately $-2.7$, consistent with $n \sim -3$. Conversely, if the density spectrum is steep (i.e., $n < -3$), the observed 21 cm intensity fluctuations may originate from velocity fluctuations, yielding a spectral index of $-3 + m/2$. With $m = 2/3$, this results in a slope of $-8/3 \approx -2.7$, matching the observed value. The crux of the matter lies in determining whether the density spectrum in nature is such that $n \approx -3$, thereby aligning the slopes of $P_{2v}$ and $P_{2\rho}$ in thin slices, or if instead, we observe $P_{2\rho}$ with $n < -3$.

More studies of Galactic HI using VCA are clearly needed. Since the VCA can also analyze other emission lines, such as CO and Hα, it is essential to cross-correlate turbulence properties across HI, molecular, and ionized gas to gain insights into the dynamic coupling of different interstellar phases.

4. Complementary Statistical Tools

The velocity and density power spectra of turbulence do not fully capture its characteristics. These spectra fail to account for turbulence intermittency—its variations in time and space—and its topological structure in the presence of different phases.

“Genus analysis” is a good tool for studying the topology of turbulence (see review by Lazarian 1999), receiving well-deserved recognition for cosmological studies (Gott et al. 1989). Consider an area on the sky with contours of projected density. The 2D genus, $G(\nu)$ , is the difference between the number of regions with a projected density higher than $\nu$ and those with densities lower than $\nu$ . Fig. 4 shows the 2D genus as the function of $\nu$ for a Gaussian distribution of densities (completely symmetric curve), for MHD isothermal simulations with Mach number 2.5, and for HI in SMC (Fig. 4b).

In cosmological research focusing on the Large Scale Structure of the universe, scientists have computed hierarchical amplitudes under diverse initial conditions to facilitate comparison with empirical data. This methodology is particularly useful in analyzing the interstellar medium, where it enables the examination of different sky regions. However, the practical application of this approach is hindered by two significant challenges: an increase in noise levels when employing multipoint statistics and difficulties associated with averaging along the line of sight. Addressing these limitations remains an important area for future investigation.

Magnetic turbulence is expected to exhibit anisotropy, with the magnetic field dictating its directional properties. This anisotropic nature opens up innovative avenues for investigating and understanding the behavior of magnetic fields.

Determining the degree of anisotropy for HI statistics across different regions of the Galaxy is both challenging and crucial. This information offers insights into the nature of HI turbulence and serves as a diagnostic tool for the interstellar magnetic field. For example, analyzing the structure functions of HI intensity \( S(\theta,\phi) = \langle (I({\bf e}_{1}) - I({\bf e}_{2}))^{2} \rangle \) as a function of positional angle \( \phi \) for individual data subsets can reveal the magnetic field direction in various sky regions, assuming the turbulence is anisotropic as expected. This method is akin to determining magnetic field direction through synchrotron radiation fluctuations (see Lazarian 1992), but its potential applicability is significantly broader.

5. Summary

In this work, I deviate from conventional statistical hydrodynamics to present a method for extracting 3D velocity and density power spectra from position-position-velocity (PPV) data cubes. This approach is influenced by personal preference and the desire to connect well-established 3D density and velocity statistics with observational data. Despite this focus, the subject remains extensive, prompting a concentration on atomic hydrogen (HI) studies as a practical test case. The advantages of HI as a test case are discussed in Section 2, while Sections 3 and 4 address the challenges of space-velocity mapping and velocity-slice spectra, respectively. Section 5 provides insights into the interpretation of 21 cm data from the Galaxy and the SMC. Section 6 explores potential anisotropies in statistics caused by magnetic fields and introduces a novel technique for their statistical analysis. Section 7 examines the formation of emissivity enhancements, such as filaments and clouds, and Section 8 discusses the generalization of this method. Acknowledging the limitations of traditional hydrodynamic turbulence descriptions, alternative approaches like 2D Genus statistics, Spectral Correlation Functions, and Bispectrum are explored in Section 9. A summary of the findings is provided in Section 10.
