Abstract

Based on our long ( $\sim 300$ ks) 2007 XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365, we report here on the spectral and timing behaviour of two ultraluminous X-ray sources, which had previously reached isotropic X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm X}\approx 4\times 10^{40}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} ( $0.3$ – $10$ keV band). In 2007, they were in a lower state ( $L_{\rm X}\approx 5\times 10^{39}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} , and $L_{\rm X}\approx 1.5\times 10^{39}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} for X1 and X2, respectively). Their X-ray spectra were dominated by power-laws with photon indices $\Gamma\approx 1.8$ and $\Gamma\approx 1.2$ , respectively. Thus, their spectra were similar to those at their outburst peaks. Both sources have been seen to vary by a factor of 20 in luminosity over the years, but their spectra are always dominated by a hard power-law; unlike most stellar-mass BHs, they have never been found in a canonical high/soft state dominated by a standard disk. The lack of a canonical high/soft state seems to be a common feature of ULXs. We speculate that the different kind of donor star and/or a persistently super-Eddington accretion rate during their outbursts may prevent accretion flows in ULXs from settling into steady standard disks.

1. Introduction

Accretion onto stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is characterized by distinct state transitions, first identified through X-ray spectral studies of Cygnus X-1 by Tananbaum et al. (1972) and later understood as fundamental changes in the accretion flow structure, also observed in radio and optical behavior. The canonical scheme of BH accretion, outlined by Remillard & McClintock (2006), consists of three primary states: low/hard, high/soft, and very high. The low/hard state is marked by a power-law X-ray spectrum, likely produced by inverse-Compton scattering of soft seed photons, although the location and geometry of the scattering region remain unclear, with proposed models including a hot corona, advection-dominated accretion flow, fast jet, or hot boundary layer. In contrast, the high/soft state is dominated by thermal X-ray emission from an optically thick, geometrically thin disk, as described by Shakura & Sunyaev (1973). The very high state, observed near Eddington luminosity, is poorly understood, with a power-law component in the X-ray band, often steeper than in the low/hard state, accompanied by a less prominent thermal disk component. The power-law component is thought to arise from Comptonization of soft X-ray photons, while the disk component's spectrum may be modified by electron scattering and radiation trapping. The state transitions are believed to be triggered by changes in the mass accretion rate, with the low/hard state occurring at rates below a few percent of the Eddington rate, the high/soft state at higher rates, and the very high state at rates approaching or exceeding the Eddington limit. Additionally, radio observations have revealed the presence of a steady jet in the low/hard state, which may carry a significant portion of the accretion power, whereas the jet is suppressed in the high/soft state, and strong X-ray and radio flares are observed in the very high state.

One of the interesting properties of the standard disk spectrum in the high/soft state is that we expect a simple relation between the disk luminosity, the disk peak temperature, and the BH mass Makishima et al. (1996) : $L_{\rm disk}\approx 4\pi R_{\rm in}^{2}\sigma T_{\rm in}^{4}\sim M_{\rm BH}^{2}T_{\rm in}^{4}$ . In this formula, the inner-disk radius $R_{\rm in}\approx 6R_{\rm g}$ for a non-rotating BH, where the gravitational radius $R_{\rm g}=M_{\rm BH}$ in geometric units. This relation has been observationally confirmed for many Galactic BHs, and the BH masses inferred with this method are generally in agreement (within a factor of 2) with direct kinematic measurements. Another useful property of the high/soft state is the simple parameterization of disk luminosity and temperature with the accretion rate: for a fixed BH mass, $L_{\rm disk}\sim\dot{m}$ , $T_{\rm in}\sim\dot{m}^{1/4}$ Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) .

The canonical state classification has also been applied to AGN, justified by the self-similar nature of many physical processes near a BH horizon, provided that characteristic sizes, timescales and disk temperatures are properly rescaled by the BH mass Maccarone, Gallo & Fender (2003) . In this scheme, low-luminosity AGN and LINERs may represent the low/hard state, typical AGN and Seyferts may be in the high/soft state, and the most powerful quasars and FR-II radio galaxies may be in the very high state.

Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are accreting black holes that exhibit observed fluxes corresponding to incredibly high isotropic X-ray luminosities, reaching up to a few $10^{40}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}, which surpasses the Eddington limit for the stellar black holes found in our Local Group, as recently reviewed by Roberts (2007). The origin of this excessive luminosity remains a topic of debate, with several possible explanations, including the presence of extremely massive stellar black holes with masses between $30$ – $70M_{\odot}$, intermediate-mass black holes, collimated radiation, or super-Eddington luminosity, as proposed by various studies (Pakull & Mirioni, 2002; Miller & Colbert, 2004; King et al., 2001; Begelman, 2002). Ultimately, it is unclear whether ULXs represent a distinct physical class of accreting black holes with their own set of characteristics or simply a different accretion state of ordinary stellar-mass black holes.

In the absence of direct kinematic measurements of black hole (BH) masses in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), due to the faintness of their optical counterparts at distances of several megaparsecs, X-ray spectroscopy can potentially provide strong constraints. By analogy with the properties of stellar-mass BHs, observing a ULX in different spectral states over time could allow for estimates of its luminosity at the transition between the low/hard and high/soft states, or its maximum luminosity in the low/hard state, as well as the fitted disk luminosity and temperature in the high/soft state. This approach has been used by Winter, Mushotzky & Reynolds (2006) and Miller & Colbert (2004) to support the existence of BHs with masses greater than $10^{3}M_{\odot}$. However, this method relies on the assumption that ULXs follow the same pattern of canonical spectral states as stellar-mass BHs, specifically transitioning from the low/hard to the high/soft state at a luminosity of a few percent of the Eddington limit ($L_{\rm Edd}$) and being dominated by a standard disk in the high/soft state.

Until now, testing these assumptions has been challenging due to a lack of comprehensive data. Unlike Galactic black holes, which can be monitored daily or weekly, ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are typically observed only sporadically, with intervals of several months or years between observations. This sporadic monitoring has hindered our understanding of the sequence and timescale of their spectral state transitions. However, a few ULXs have now accumulated sufficient data over the years, enabling a comparative analysis of their behavior with that of transient Galactic black holes.

NGC 1365 X1 is a rare source that has been detected by multiple observatories, including ROSAT, ASCA, Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton, between 1993 and 2007, with peak luminosities of approximately 3-4 × 10^40 erg s^-1 in 1995 and 2006. Another nearby transient ULX, X2, reached a similar luminosity in 2006, but was significantly fainter or undetected in earlier observations. The host galaxy of these ULXs is a luminous spiral galaxy in the Fornax cluster, classified as SBb(s)I, with a total gas mass of approximately 3 × 10^10 M⊙, a kinematic mass of approximately 3.6 × 10^11 M⊙, and a star formation rate of approximately 10 M⊙ yr^-1. Located at a Cepheid distance of 19 ± 1 Mpc, where 1 arcsec corresponds to 92 pc, we present the results of our approximately 300-ks XMM-Newton observation of NGC 1365 X1, which was conducted over three orbits between June 30 and July 5, 2007. Our analysis focuses on interpreting the X-ray properties of the two ULXs, particularly their hard power-law spectra, in the context of their long-term behavior.

2. Observations and data analysis

XMM-Newton observed NGC 1365 from 2007 June 30 to July 05, with Guido Risaliti as the Principal Investigator, using the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) in Full Window mode with a Medium filter. A true-colour image of the combined MOS dataset is shown in Figure 1. Although the primary target was the highly variable Seyfert nucleus, which is reported on elsewhere (Risaliti et al. 2008, in prep.), this study focuses on other aspects of the observation. The XMM-Newton Science Analysis System (SAS) version 7.1.0 was used to process and filter the event files, extract lightcurves, and obtain spectra. However, several background flares occurred during the three observations, affecting the signal-to-noise ratio, particularly for non-nuclear sources like X1 and X2 at photon energies above 5 keV. To mitigate this, various rejection thresholds were applied, but the bright nucleus was less affected by the flares, except for a strong, short flare at the end of the second observation. Ultimately, good-time-intervals of 78.4 ks, 107.9 ks, and 55.9 ks for EPIC-pn, and 96.6 ks, 123.3 ks, and 92.8 ks for EPIC-MOS, were selected for spectral analysis (Table 1), while the whole live exposure time was used for timing analysis, with the caveat that intervals with high background yield lower signal-to-noise bins in the lightcurve.

The extraction of spectra and lightcurves for X1 was complicated by its location on a chip gap in the pn detector, resulting in a loss of approximately half the counts in each exposure. Although the ancillary response function accounts for the reduced effective area of the source region, the different point spread functions of hard and soft photons could potentially introduce spectral shape changes due to the chip gap. However, since X1 is not located on a chip gap in the MOS images, we were able to verify the consistency of the MOS and pn spectra through separate fittings and comparisons. Our analysis suggests that while the chip gap may have reduced the achievable signal-to-noise ratio, it does not appear to have significantly impacted the spectral results.

The radius of the source extraction region was set to $20\arcsec$ for X1, the brightest non-nuclear source, while for X2, which was significantly fainter than in 2006, a smaller radius of $8\arcsec$ was used to minimize contamination from a nearby source of similar brightness. Background extraction regions were carefully selected to avoid contamination, positioning them around the source regions in an optimal manner. Following the creation of response and ancillary response files using rmfgen and arfgen, we performed spectral analysis using XSPEC (Arnaud 1996). To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, the EPIC pn and MOS spectra from each observation, as well as from all observations combined, were co-added, utilizing suitably averaged response functions as per the method outlined by Page et al. (2003).

3. Main Results

We extracted background-subtracted MOS and pn lightcurves of X1 from the three observations and analyzed them using standard FTOOLS tasks with various binning choices. Our analysis revealed no significant variability between or within individual observations. Specifically, the 2007 July 02-03 EPIC-pn observation (Rev. 1385), which has the highest signal-to-noise ratio, yielded a $\chi^{2}$ probability of constancy greater than 0.9 (Figure 2), confirming the lack of variability. Furthermore, the power density spectra showed no notable features, supporting our finding of consistent flux levels.

Over the past fourteen years, X1 has exhibited strong variability, marked by two major outbursts detected by ASCA in 1995 and Chandra in 2006, as shown in Figure 3. To further investigate its behavior, we analyzed a series of short Swift monitoring observations conducted on July 21-24, 2006, totaling 19.4 ks of exposure time, which occurred three months after the Chandra observation. Our analysis revealed 23 net counts with the X-Ray Telescope, corresponding to a count rate of approximately 0.0012 count s^-1. Assuming a power-law model with a photon index of 1.8 and N_H = 5 × 10^20 cm^-2, we calculated an emitted luminosity of approximately (2.3 ± 0.5) × 10^39 erg s^-1 in the 0.3-10 keV band, which is consistent with the luminosity datapoints summarized in Soria et al. (2007) and also plotted in Figure 3.

We fitted and compared the MOS spectra of X1 from each XMM-Newton observation during the three consecutive revolutions of 2007 June 30 – July 05, and found that they are consistent with each other in terms of observed flux, absorbing column density, and spectral shape (Figure 4). The spectra are well-fitted by an absorbed power-law model, with a total absorbing column density of $\sim 5\times 10^{20}$ cm\textsuperscript{-2} and power-law photon indices of $\approx 1.7$ – $1.8$, which are consistent within the 90% confidence limit of each dataset. This consistency justifies combining the EPIC spectral data from all three observations to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.

The combined XMM-Newton/EPIC spectrum is well described by a simple power-law model, with a reduced chi-squared value of $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.03$ (156.2/152), as shown in the top panel of Figure 5 and detailed in Table 2. This fit yields an estimated unabsorbed, isotropic luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 5.3\times 10^{39}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} in the 0.3-10 keV band. In contrast to some ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that exhibit spectral curvature, our data do not show such curvature, making it easy to distinguish from alternative models like a cut-off power-law or disk-blackbody. This is evident from the poor fit of a disk-blackbody model, shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5, which results in $\chi^{2}_{\nu}>2$. Similarly, a bremsstrahlung model, although less curved than a disk-blackbody, does not fit the data well, with a best-fit $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.13$ (172.3/152) and $kT=(5.6\pm 0.6)$ keV.

A power-law is the best-fitting 1-component phenomenological model, and it makes no assumptions on the underlying physical process. It is of course possible to fit the same spectrum equally well with other, more complex physical models, provided that they look exactly like a power-law in the observed band. For example, we tried the Comptonization model comptt and found that we could get equally good fits by fixing the seed-photon temperature at any value $kT_{0}\lesssim 0.1$ keV, if the coronal temperature $kT_{e}\gtrsim 2$ keV and the optical depth $\tau\gtrsim 0.5$ . The best-fitting comptt model has $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.03(155.2/151)$ for $kT_{e}\approx 2.9$ keV and $\tau\approx 6.2$ (warm, optically-thick corona). But we also get a statistically equivalent fit ( $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.04(157.8/152)$ ) for example for $kT_{e}\gtrsim 50$ keV and $\tau\equiv 0.5$ (hot, optically-thin corona). Both models are indistinguishable from a power-law, with the available data.

We then added a diskbb component, representing a soft excess, to the power-law model, yielding a best-fitting model with $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.02(153.2/150)$, $kT_{\rm in}=0.35^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$ keV, and $\Gamma=1.66^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$. However, this addition does not result in a statistically significant improvement over the simple power-law model. Furthermore, the upper limit to the diskbb normalization indicates that any potential disk-blackbody component would contribute less than $\approx 3.6\times 10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} in the $0.3$–$10$ keV band, or $\approx 5.4\times 10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} bolometrically, which is less than $7\%$ of the power-law contribution.

We investigated the possibility of a break or cut-off in the power-law at high energies. The addition of an exponential cut-off does not improve the fit, as it introduces excessive curvature in the model. In contrast, a break at $E_{\rm b}=7.5\pm 0.9$ keV yields $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.00(150.3/150)$, which represents a marginally significant improvement over a simple power-law fit and aligns with the visual indication of a spectral downturn (Figure 5, top panel). However, due to the low signal-to-noise level and uncertainties in background subtraction, which is contaminated by strong AGN emission above approximately 6 keV, we cannot assign physical significance to this potential break. Notably, a similar marginal evidence of a break at around 6 keV was also reported in a 2004 XMM-Newton observation by Soria et al. (2007).

The power-law photon index of $\Gamma\approx 1.8$ (Table 2) is consistent with previous measurements, including those from the Chandra spectra during the 2006 April outburst (see Table 2 for best-fitting parameters) and the ASCA, Chandra, and XMM-Newton spectra from 1995-2003. However, the 2004 XMM-Newton spectra revealed a distinct characteristic: a soft excess with an inner disk temperature of $kT_{\rm in}\approx 0.3$ – $0.4$ keV, which contributed approximately 25-30% of the X-ray luminosity, in addition to a dominant power-law component with a high-energy break. At that time, the unabsorbed luminosity was approximately $10^{40}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}, as reported by Soria et al. (2007).

The column density in the 2007 spectrum is consistent with the values previously fitted to the XMM-Newton spectra when X1 had X-ray luminosities $\lesssim 10^{40}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} . The neutral column density was instead a few times higher during the 2006 outburst, when a single-component power-law model was used Soria et al. (2007) . As a further check that the decrease in column density between 2006 and 2007 is real and not due to the appearance of an underlying soft component, we fitted the 2007 spectrum with an additional diskbb component (leaving its temperature and normalization as free parameters) and $N_{\rm H}$ fixed at the 2006 value. We obtain $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.15(173.9/151)$ which is significantly worse than the low-column best fit. Besides, there was also strong ionized absorption at the peak of the 2006 outburst Soria et al. (2007) , which is absent from the 2007 spectra.

We re-examined the 2006 data to investigate the scenario where the column density was as low as in 2007 or at other epochs. Starting with the best-fitting model from Soria et al. (2007), which had a reduced chi-squared of 0.72, we fixed the column density at $N_{\rm H} = 4.5 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. However, a single power-law model with this lower column density was not acceptable, yielding a reduced chi-squared of 1.06, as it failed to reproduce the low-energy downturn. A disk-blackbody model with low $N_{\rm H}$ did not improve the fit, with a reduced chi-squared of 0.76, as it overpredicted the high-energy curvature, even with a best-fitting inner disk temperature of $kT_{\rm in} \approx 1.4$ keV. In contrast, Comptonization models with low $N_{\rm H}$ and a seed photon temperature of approximately 0.3 keV provided statistically equivalent fits to the high-$N_{\rm H}$ power-law model. For example, using the bmc Comptonization model, we obtained a reduced chi-squared of 0.72 with a best-fitting seed photon temperature of $kT_{0} = 0.27^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ keV. Notably, applying these Comptonization models to the 2007 spectra required a lower seed photon temperature of $\lesssim 0.1$ keV. Additionally, we found that the ionized absorption component present at the peak of the 2006 outburst could not be eliminated or replaced with any other simple spectral component.

The transient ultraluminous X-ray source X2 (Figure 1) was discovered serendipitously during Chandra observations in 2006 by Strateva and Komossa. Notably, this source is distinct from the one labeled as X2 in Fig. 2 of Soria et al. (2007). X2 underwent a rapid outburst in 2006, with its flux increasing by a factor of 7 over just two days, coinciding with an outburst from the unrelated ULX X1. In contrast, our 2007 XMM-Newton observations found X2 to be much fainter and less variable, with a consistent flux across three observations within a 1σ uncertainty. Despite the difference in brightness, the X-ray spectrum of X2 remained remarkably similar between 2006 and 2007, characterized by a hard power-law slope of Γ ≈ 1.1-1.2 (Table 3 and Figure 6). However, the column density decreased by an order of magnitude from the 2006 outburst peak to 2007, to approximately 10^21 cm^-2. The unabsorbed isotropic luminosity of X2 peaked at approximately 3.7 × 10^40 erg s^-1 in 2006, and decreased to about 1.5 × 10^39 erg s^-1 in 2007.

As for X1, we tried fitting the 2007 XMM-Newton spectrum of X2 with alternative models, even though the lower signal-to-noise makes multi-component models even less constrained. A diskbb model provides a formally acceptable fit ( $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.15(113.6/99)$ , compared with $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.12(110.8/99)$ for the power-law model). But the best-fitting temperature $kT_{\rm in}=3.48^{+1.31}_{-0.66}$ keV is unphysically high for a standard disk, and the normalization corresponds to an unphysically small inner radius $r_{\rm in}(\cos\theta)^{0.5}\approx 7$ km. A bremsstrahlung model provides a formally acceptable fit ( $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.14(112.6/99)$ ) for $kT\gtrsim 48$ keV. The Comptonization model comptt with seed photon temperature fixed at $kT_{0}\equiv 0.1$ keV and optically thin corona ( $\tau\equiv 0.5$ ) gives an equivalent fit ( $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.12(111.3/99)$ ) for $kT_{e}\gtrsim 250$ keV. For an optically-thick corona ( $\tau\equiv 10$ ), the best-fitting model has $kT_{e}=2.73^{+0.66}_{-0.38}$ keV ( $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.11(109.7/99)$ ). An exponential cutoff does not improve the power-law fit ( $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.12(110.8/99)$ ), and the cutoff is constrained to be at energies $\gtrsim 5.8$ keV. A break does not improve the power-law fit, either. Adding a soft disk-blackbody component to the power-law does not improve the fit: the best fitting model has a null normalization for diskbb , and an upper limit of $\approx 25$ % for the disk-blackbody contribution. In short, as was the case for X1, also X2 can be fitted by various physical models, as long as they look exactly like a hard power law in the observed band. We then fixed the absorbing column density to the 2006 value (Table 3) and verified that it is not consistent with the 2007 data, even with the addition of an unconstrained disk-blackbody component to compensate for that. The best-fitting high-absorption model has $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.25(122.5/98)$ . Finally, we re-examined the 2006 data, and tried fitting them with the same low absorption as in 2007. As for the case of X1, we find that Comptonization models with low absorption but high seed-photon blackbody temperature ( $kT_{0}\approx 0.9$ keV) give fits that are only slightly worse than the high-absorption models. However, such scenario is too contrived, and unseen in any other accreting source. Hence, we conclude that the decrease in absorption at lower luminosities is physically significant for X2.

In previous years, X2 was not detected by ASCA, but it may have been marginally detected by ROSAT/HRI in 1995, with a luminosity of approximately $4\times 10^{39}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} in the $0.3$ – $10$ keV range, assuming the spectral parameters from the 2007 XMM-Newton spectrum. However, this detection is uncertain due to potential source confusion. Subsequent observations also suggest that X2 was in a low state, with a luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\lesssim 3\times 10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} during the 2002 Chandra observation, and possibly $\sim$ a few $10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} during the 2004 XMM-Newton observations, although the latter detection is also uncertain due to confusion with nearby sources. Additionally, X2 was not detected in the 2006 July Swift observations, with an upper limit of $L_{\rm X}\lesssim 10^{39}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}.

3.1. Time variability of X1

We extracted background-subtracted MOS and pn lightcurves of X1 from the three observations and analyzed them using standard FTOOLS tasks with various binning options. Our analysis revealed no significant variability between or within individual observations. Specifically, the 2007 July 02-03 EPIC-pn observation (Rev. 1385), which has the highest signal-to-noise ratio, yielded a $\chi^{2}$ probability of constancy greater than 0.9 (Figure 2), further supporting the lack of variability. Additionally, the power density spectra showed no notable features, confirming the overall stability of the source.

Over the past fourteen years, X1 has exhibited strong variability, with two major outbursts observed by ASCA in 1995 and Chandra in 2006, as shown in Figure 3. To further investigate its behavior, we analyzed a series of short Swift monitoring observations conducted on July 21-24, 2006, approximately three months after the Chandra observation, with a total exposure time of 19.4 ks. From these observations, we detected 23 net counts using the X-Ray Telescope, corresponding to a count rate of approximately 0.0012 count s^{-1}. This translates to an emitted luminosity of approximately $(2.3\pm 0.5)\times 10^{39}$ erg s^{-1} in the 0.3-10 keV band, assuming a power-law model with a photon index of 1.8 and a hydrogen column density of $5\times 10^{20}$ cm^{-2}, as illustrated in Figure 3.

3.2. Spectral analysis: X1 is a power-law ULX

Firstly, we fitted and compared the MOS spectra of X1 from each XMM-Newton observation during the three consecutive revolutions of 2007 June 30 – July 05. We find that the three spectra are consistent with each other with regard to observed flux, absorbing column density and spectral shape (Figure 4). All three spectra are well fitted by an absorbed power-law model with total absorbing column density $\sim 5\times 10^{20}$ cm \textsuperscript{-2} and power-law photon indices $\approx 1.7$ – $1.8$ , consistent within the 90% confidence limit of each dataset. Hence, we are justified in adding the EPIC spectral data from all three observations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.

The combined XMM-Newton/EPIC spectrum is well described by a simple power-law model, with a reduced chi-squared value of $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.03$ (156.2/152), as shown in the top panel of Figure 5 and detailed in Table 2. This fit yields an estimated unabsorbed, isotropic luminosity of $L_{\rm X}\approx 5.3\times 10^{39}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} in the 0.3-10 keV band. In contrast to some ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that exhibit spectral curvature, the spectrum here is well represented by a power law, with no evidence of curvature. This is demonstrated by the poor fit of alternative models, including a disk-blackbody model (bottom panel of Figure 5, $\chi^{2}_{\nu}>2$) and a bremsstrahlung model, which has a best-fit $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.13$ (172.3/152) for $kT=(5.6\pm 0.6)$ keV, indicating that these models do not adequately describe the data.

A power-law model is the most straightforward and best-fitting one-component phenomenological description, as it makes no assumptions about the underlying physical process. Although other, more complex models can also fit the spectrum equally well if they mimic a power-law within the observed band, the power-law remains the most parsimonious choice. For instance, we tested the Comptonization model comptt and found that it could replicate the spectrum with comparable accuracy to the power-law, but only if certain conditions were met: the seed-photon temperature was $kT_{0}\lesssim 0.1$ keV, the coronal temperature was $kT_{e}\gtrsim 2$ keV, and the optical depth was $\tau\gtrsim 0.5$. Notably, two distinct comptt models yielded statistically equivalent fits, one with a warm, optically-thick corona ($kT_{e}\approx 2.9$ keV and $\tau\approx 6.2$) and another with a hot, optically-thin corona ($kT_{e}\gtrsim 50$ keV and $\tau\equiv 0.5$), both of which were indistinguishable from a power-law given the available data.

We then added a diskbb component, representing a soft excess, to the power-law model, yielding a best-fitting model with $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.02(153.2/150)$, $kT_{\rm in}=0.35^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$ keV, and $\Gamma=1.66^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$. However, this addition does not result in a statistically significant improvement over the simple power-law model. Furthermore, the upper limit to the diskbb normalization indicates that any potential disk-blackbody component would contribute no more than $3.6\times 10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} in the 0.3-10 keV band, or $5.4\times 10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} bolometrically, which is less than 7% of the power-law contribution.

Finally, we looked for a possible break or cut-off in the power-law at high energies. An exponential cut-off does not improve the fit, because it introduces excessive curvature in the model. A break at the energy $E_{\rm b}=7.5\pm 0.9$ keV gives $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.00(150.3/150)$ , which is, formally, a marginally significant improvement from a simple power-law fit, and confirms the visual impression of a spectral downturn (Figure 5, top panel). However, given the low signal-to-noise level at those channel energies, and the uncertainties in the background subtraction (contaminated by the strong AGN emission above $\approx 6$ keV), we cannot attribute any physical meaning to this possible break. Nonetheless, we recall that there was also marginal evidence of a break at $\approx 6$ keV in one of the XMM-Newton observations of 2004 Soria et al. (2007) .

The power-law photon index of $\Gamma\approx 1.8$ (Table 2) is consistent with previous measurements, including those from Chandra spectra during the 2006 April outburst (see Table 2 for best-fitting parameters) and from ASCA, Chandra, and XMM-Newton spectra between 1995 and 2003. However, the 2004 XMM-Newton spectra revealed a different characteristic, with X1 exhibiting a soft excess (inner disk temperature $kT_{\rm in}\approx 0.3$ – $0.4$ keV) that contributed approximately 25–30% of the X-ray luminosity, alongside a dominant power-law component with a high-energy break. At that time, the unabsorbed luminosity was approximately $10^{40}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}, as reported by Soria et al. (2007).

The column density in the 2007 spectrum is consistent with previous fits to XMM-Newton spectra, which had X-ray luminosities of $\lesssim 10^{40}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}. In contrast, the neutral column density was significantly higher during the 2006 outburst, as found by Soria et al. (2007) using a single-component power-law model. To verify that the decrease in column density between 2006 and 2007 is not an artifact of an emerging soft component, we tested the 2007 spectrum with an additional diskbb component, while fixing $N_{\rm H}$ at its 2006 value. This yielded a significantly poorer fit, with $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.15(173.9/151)$. Furthermore, strong ionized absorption present at the peak of the 2006 outburst, as reported by Soria et al. (2007), is absent in the 2007 spectra, supporting the conclusion that the column density decrease is real.

We re-examined the 2006 data to investigate the scenario where the column density was as low as in 2007 or at other epochs. Starting with the best-fitting model from Soria et al. (2007), which had a reduced chi-squared of 0.72, we fixed the column density at $N_{\rm H}=4.5\times 10^{20}$ cm\textsuperscript{-2} and re-fitted the data. However, a single power-law model was no longer acceptable, with a reduced chi-squared of 1.06, as it failed to reproduce the low-energy downturn. A disk-blackbody model with low $N_{\rm H}$ did not improve the fit, with a reduced chi-squared of 0.76, as it overpredicted the high-energy curvature, even with a best-fitting inner disk temperature of $kT_{\rm in}\approx 1.4$ keV. In contrast, Comptonization models with low $N_{\rm H}$ and a seed photon temperature of approximately 0.3 keV provided statistically equivalent fits to the high-$N_{\rm H}$ power-law model. For example, using the bmc Comptonization model, we obtained a reduced chi-squared of 0.72 with a best-fitting seed photon temperature of $kT_{0}=0.27^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ keV. Notably, applying these Comptonization models to the 2007 spectra required a lower seed photon temperature of $\lesssim 0.1$ keV. Additionally, we found that the ionized absorption component present at the peak of the 2006 outburst could not be eliminated or replaced with any other simple spectral component.

3.3. X2: a transient, hard power-law ULX

The transient ULX X2 (Figure 1) was serendipitously discovered during the 2006 Chandra observations Strateva & Komossa (2008) \footnote{ 1 It is not the same source designated as X2 in Fig. 2 of Soria et al. (2007) .} . It underwent an outburst with a rapid rise time (a factor of 7 in two days; Strateva & Komossa (2008) ) at the same time as the unrelated ULX X1 was also in outburst. In our 2007 XMM-Newton observations, the source was much fainter, and much less variable; the observed flux is the same in the three observations, within $1\sigma$ . Remarkably, the slope of the X-ray spectrum was similar in 2006 and 2007, well fitted by a hard power-law with $\Gamma\approx 1.1$ – $1.2$ (Table 3 and Figure 6). The column density in 2007 was $\approx 10^{21}$ cm \textsuperscript{-2} , an order of magnitude less than at the peak of the 2006 outburst. The unabsorbed isotropic luminosity reached $\approx 3.7\times 10^{40}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} in 2006, and was down to $\approx 1.5\times 10^{39}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} in 2007.

We attempted to fit the 2007 XMM-Newton spectrum of X2 using alternative models, despite the lower signal-to-noise ratio making multi-component models less constrained. Although a diskbb model yields a formally acceptable fit, with $\chi^{2}_{\nu}=1.15$, the best-fitting temperature is unphysically high, and the normalization implies an implausibly small inner radius. Similarly, bremsstrahlung and Comptonization models provide acceptable fits, but require unrealistic parameters, such as high temperatures or optical depths. In contrast, a power-law model with an exponential cutoff or a break does not improve the fit, and adding a soft disk-blackbody component also does not enhance the fit. Notably, various physical models can fit the data as long as they resemble a hard power law in the observed band. Fixing the absorbing column density to the 2006 value results in a poor fit to the 2007 data, even with the addition of a disk-blackbody component. Re-examining the 2006 data, we found that Comptonization models with low absorption and high seed-photon temperature can provide acceptable fits, but this scenario is unlikely and unprecedented in other accreting sources. Therefore, we conclude that the decrease in absorption at lower luminosities is physically significant for X2.

In previous years, X2 was not seen by ASCA . It was claimed Strateva & Komossa (2008) that it may have been marginally detected by ROSAT /HRI in 1995, at a count rate corresponding to a $0.3$ – $10$ keV luminosity $\approx 4\times 10^{39}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} , if we assume the spectral parameters of the 2007 XMM-Newton spectrum; however, this detection is doubtful, because of likely source confusion. X2 was also in a low state ( $L_{\rm X}\lesssim 3\times 10^{38}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} ) during the 2002 Chandra observation. It may be marginally detected (but confused with nearby, brighter sources) in the 2004 XMM-Newton observations, at a luminosity $\sim$ a few $10^{38}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} . It is not detected ( $L_{\rm X}\lesssim 10^{39}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} ) in the Swift observations of 2006 July.

4. Discussion and Speculations

The strongly star-forming spiral galaxy NGC 1365 hosts numerous X-ray sources that have surpassed the ULX threshold in recent years. This study focuses on two sources, X1 and X2, which have exhibited recent outbursts and significant flux variations. Notably, X1 has a extensive observational history dating back to 1993, providing valuable insights into its behavior. The X-ray spectra of both sources are consistently dominated by broad, power-law-like components, with photon indices of $\Gamma\approx 1.8\pm 0.1$ for X1 and $\Gamma\approx 1.2\pm 0.1$ for X2, regardless of their luminosity state, which has varied by a factor of 20. Additionally, X1 occasionally displays a cool, thermal soft component alongside its dominant hard power-law component, as observed in 2004 XMM-Newton data. A key distinction between the higher and lower luminosity states of both sources is the increased intrinsic column density in the higher state, observed in the $0.3$ – $10$ keV band. However, the underlying cause of this phenomenon, whether related to enhanced mass inflow, outflow, or both, remains unclear due to limited data.

Based on their spectral appearance, it may be tempting to categorize the two ULXs as being in the power-law-dominated low/hard state, as defined by the canonical black hole (BH) spectral states. This classification is supported by the fact that other luminous ULXs, with X-ray luminosities up to $3\times 10^{39}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}, can be well-fitted by a single power-law with a photon index between 1 and 2, similar to those found in the low/hard state of Galactic BHs. However, a closer examination of the long-term variability of X1 and X2 reveals a different story. Unlike most stellar-mass Galactic BHs, which typically cycle between the low/hard and high/soft states, these two sources have remained in a hard state over the years, despite changes in luminosity. In contrast, Galactic soft X-ray transients usually begin an outburst in the hard state, but quickly transition to the soft state within a few days, and then spend most of their bright time, often several weeks or months, in the high/soft state, characterized by standard disk-blackbody emission with $L\sim T_{\rm in}^{4}$ and $0.1\lesssim L\lesssim L_{\rm Edd}$.

The most luminous and well-studied ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have not been found in a canonical high/soft state. While some ULXs exhibit a convex spectrum with varying degrees of curvature, their peak color temperatures are significantly higher than expected for a standard disk, implying a luminosity that exceeds the Eddington limit. This inconsistency with the standard-disk model can be interpreted in two ways: either the emission originates from a hot, super-Eddington slim disk or it is Comptonized emission from a warm, optically-thick corona covering the inner part of the disk. A subgroup of ULXs, including NGC 1365 X1, occasionally displays a thermal soft excess in addition to a power-law component, but this excess contributes less than 30% of the total luminosity. Notably, this phenomenon is not unique to ULXs, as Galactic black holes in the low/hard state can also exhibit a non-dominant soft excess from the truncated outer disk. Overall, despite the presence of thermal components in some ULX spectra, neither subgroup corresponds to the canonical high/soft state, characterized by disk dominance.

Based on the previous arguments, we propose three possible scenarios to explain the spectral state of hard power-law ULXs, such as X1 and X2, and their variability. The first scenario suggests that these ULXs are intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) in the low/hard state, where the hard power-law spectra are a result of a true low/hard state. If all accreting BHs undergo a transition from a low/hard to a high/soft state at luminosities around a few percent of the Eddington limit, then ULXs with hard power-law spectra and luminosities of approximately $10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ would require intermediate-mass BHs with masses greater than a few thousand solar masses. However, this scenario implies that ULXs represent a distinct physical class of BHs that never transition to the high/soft state due to insufficient accretion rates from their donor stars. Currently, this interpretation is considered the least likely due to the lack of supporting evidence and theoretical justification for such intermediate-mass BHs.

In the super-Eddington state, stellar-mass black holes (BHs) exhibit characteristics that can be observed in various types of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), including power-law ULXs with or without soft excess and convex-spectra ULXs. These sources are believed to be in the very high state or super-Eddington regime, which is marked by a combination of Compton scattering, photon trapping, slim-disk energy advection, and massive radiation-driven outflows. This regime is characterized by black hole masses of approximately $10M_{\odot}$, isotropic X-ray luminosities ranging from $1$ to $30L_{\rm Edd}$, and mass accretion rates of a few to $\sim 1000$. As a result, ULXs in this scenario represent a distinct accretion state of normal stellar-mass BHs, where their accretion rate and luminosity always exceed the Eddington limit, preventing the observation of their canonical high/soft state.

c) Massive stellar BHs without a high/soft state . In this scenario (somewhat intermediate between the other two), BHs in ULXs have masses $\sim 30$ – $100M_{\odot}$ (at the upper end of the high-mass X-ray binary distribution), and isotropic luminosities $L_{\rm X}\sim 0.1$ to a few $L_{\rm Edd}$ . The main observational motivation for this massive-stellar-BH scenario comes from the observed downturn in the ULX luminosity distribution at $L_{\rm X}\approx 2\times 10^{40}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} Grimm, Gilfanov & Sunyaev (2003) , which can be interpreted as $\sim$ the characteristic Eddington luminosity for the ULX population. This implies that the isotropic luminosity of most ULXs is below Eddington. In turns, this means that ULXs must follow a different canonical sequence of state transitions than Galactic BHs, because they are always dominated by Comptonized emission at luminosities below, near and slightly above Eddington, without a “naked-disk” high/soft state in between. If there is a direct disk component, it is always less important than the Comptonized component, or it may be a slim-disk component for the most luminous sources. Following this interpretation, there is no longer a gap between low/hard and very high state, just a continuous range of coronal optical depths (getting thicker at higher $\dot{m}$ ) and temperatures (getting cooler); one “state” can morph directly into the other.

We propose that scenario c) is the most consistent with multiband observations, although some ULXs may also exist in the highly super-Eddington state of scenario b). A key factor distinguishing these scenarios is the relative change in accretion rate required to produce a given change in luminosity. In scenario c), similar relative changes in accretion rate can result in luminosity changes between approximately 0.1 and 1 times the Eddington limit. In contrast, scenario b) exhibits strong radiative saturation above the Eddington limit, with luminosity scaling as $L\sim(1+\ln\dot{m})$. This means that luminosity increases between 1 and 10 times the Eddington limit require enormous increases in accretion rate, potentially constraining the underlying mechanism and leading to noticeable effects on the optical counterpart or outflow density.

The lack of a canonical high/soft state in ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) may be attributed to differences in their donor stars and mass transfer mechanisms, rather than the mass of their black holes. Unlike Galactic black holes, which are typically found in low-mass X-ray binaries with low-mass donor stars, the most luminous ULXs are thought to have massive OB donor stars with masses greater than 10 solar masses. These OB stars can provide the necessary mass transfer rates to power the high luminosities of ULXs, and their evolutionary stages can influence the accretion flow. As the donor star evolves, it can fill its Roche lobe, providing high-angular-momentum gas to the disk, while also supplying low-angular-momentum gas to the Comptonizing medium and jet through a sub-Keplerian wind. This two-flow scenario is similar to that proposed for some Galactic black holes with massive donors. The analogy can be extended to other systems, such as Cyg X-1, which has a similar accretion geometry and donor star to ULXs, and exhibits state transitions that are distinct from the typical high/soft state. Similarly, the accretion mode in radio galaxies may depend on the source of gas, rather than the total accretion rate, highlighting the complexity of accretion processes in different astrophysical contexts.

The arguments above may at least qualitatively explain why ULXs can retain a hard power-law spectrum even at X-ray luminosities $\sim 0.1$ – $1L_{\rm Edd}$ . The other factor that may determine the ULX state behaviour is their high accretion rate, as mentioned earlier. BH transients can switch to a soft, disk-dominated state during an outburst only if $\dot{m}\lesssim 1$ ; in that case, the accretion flow can settle into a quasi-steady standard-disk configuration. But this cannot occur if the accretion rate during their outbursts stays persistently above Eddington (the inner part of the disk cannot survive at $\dot{m}>1$ ). We suggest that some transient ULXs may switch directly from the low/hard state (at low accretion rates) to the slim-disk state (which produces a convex X-ray spectrum), or to the Compton-scattering-dominated very high state (which produces a cut-off power-law spectrum). The standard disk may only survive or be directly visible at large radii, and may produce the cool soft excess Roberts (2007) . In this scenario, the reason why ULXs have long-lasting phases of super-Eddington mass transfer rate may be due to the different mass or evolutionary stage of their donor stars, compared with the typical donor stars of Galactic BH transients.

To advance our understanding of these issues, it is essential to investigate the threshold luminosity and accretion rate at which black holes (BHs), including those in Galactic X-ray binaries, transition from the low/hard to the high/soft state. Specifically, we need to determine whether some systems can remain in a hard state up to luminosities of $\sim 0.1$ – $1L_{\rm Edd}$ and then directly evolve into the very high state. The concept of a universal threshold between the low/hard and high/soft states at $\dot{m}\sim 0.01$ is supported if the low/hard state is characterized by a radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated flow, as proposed by Esin, McClintock & Narayan (1997). However, this flow is unlikely to persist at higher accretion rates, where radiative cooling becomes more efficient. Alternative accretion models, such as the "luminous hot accretion flow" described by Yuan & Zdziarski (2004), may explain the persistence of a hard state at higher luminosities, potentially up to $0.1L_{\rm Edd}$. Further research is needed to determine whether the hard state in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) and certain active galactic nuclei (AGN) can extend to even higher luminosities, potentially due to the presence of a magnetized corona or jet, which may be favored by sub-Keplerian accretion flows. Observations of Galactic BHs, such as GX 339-4 and XTE J1550 $-$ 564, have shown low/hard to high/soft transitions at various X-ray luminosities, including values as high as $\approx 0.1L_{\rm Edd}$ (Yu et al., 2007). The existence of a linear relationship between the peak luminosity in the low/hard and high/soft states, as well as the properties of the time delay between these states, has been interpreted as evidence for a two-flow accretion geometry (Yu et al., 2007). Additionally, hard-state luminosities $\gtrsim 10^{38}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1} have been observed in the Galactic BH candidate Cyg X-3, which has a Wolf-Rayet donor with a strong wind (Hjalmarsdotter et al., 2008). Moreover, there is a group of at least 8 Galactic BHs that remain in the low/hard state throughout their outbursts (Brocksopp, Bandyopadhyay & Fender, 2004), and understanding the reasons behind this behavior will provide valuable insights into the ULX phenomenon.

If our suggestion that Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) lack a canonical high/soft state is correct, studying their radio behaviour may provide further insight. In accreting black holes, the low/hard state is characterized by a steady jet, marked by flat-spectrum radio-core emission, whereas the high/soft state is radio-quiet due to jet quenching, and the very high state is marked by radio flaring. It would be intriguing to determine if black holes that never transition to the high/soft state consistently exhibit a jet, potentially carrying a significant fraction of the accretion power, with the only transition being between a steady jet at lower luminosities and a flaring jet at higher luminosities. Currently, radio observations lack the sensitivity to detect point-like radio core emission in ULXs and monitor their short-term variability in relation to their X-ray state, although brighter, persistent, extended lobe emission has been identified in some ULXs, manifesting as optically-thin synchrotron nebulae.

4.1. Power-law versus thermal disk spectra

The strongly star-forming spiral galaxy NGC 1365 hosts numerous X-ray sources that have surpassed the ULX threshold in recent years. This study focuses on two sources, X1 and X2, which have exhibited recent outbursts and significant flux variations. Notably, X1 has a long observational history dating back to 1993, providing valuable insights into its behavior. The X-ray spectra of both sources are dominated by broad, power-law-like components, with photon indices of $\Gamma\approx 1.8\pm 0.1$ for X1 and $\Gamma\approx 1.2\pm 0.1$ for X2, regardless of their luminosity state. Although their luminosities varied by a factor of 20, the spectral shape remained relatively consistent, with the exception of a cool, thermal soft component occasionally present in X1's spectrum. A key difference between the higher and lower luminosity states of both sources is the increased intrinsic column density in the higher state, observed in the $0.3$ – $10$ keV band. However, the underlying cause of this variation, whether due to increased mass inflow, outflow, or both, remains unclear due to limited data.

Based on their spectral appearance, it may be tempting to categorize both ULXs as being in the power-law-dominated low/hard state, as defined by the canonical black hole spectral states. However, several luminous ULXs with similar X-ray luminosities ($L_{\rm X}\lesssim 3\times 10^{39}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}) are also well-described by a single power-law with a photon index of $1\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim 2$, similar to those found in the low/hard state of Galactic black holes. Nevertheless, the long-term variability of X1 and X2 suggests that their accretion state may not be the canonical low/hard state, as they have remained in a hard state over the years despite changes in luminosity. In contrast, most stellar-mass Galactic black holes exhibit recurrent state transitions between the low/hard and high/soft states, with outbursts typically starting in the hard state and rapidly switching to the soft state within a few days, after which they spend most of their bright time (weeks or months) in the high/soft state, characterized by standard disk-blackbody emission with $L\sim T_{\rm in}^{4}$ and $0.1\lesssim L\lesssim L_{\rm Edd}$.

This does not appear to be the case for ULXs: none of the most luminous or best studied sources has ever been unequivocally found in a canonical high/soft state. Some ULXs do have a convex spectrum Makishima et al. (2000) , with various degrees of curvature between a straight power-law and a disk-blackbody. But if they are formally fitted with a disk-blackbody model, their peak color temperature ( $kT_{\rm in}\sim 1.5$ – $2.5$ keV) is much higher than expected for a standard disk, and implies a luminosity $L>L_{\rm Edd}$ , inconsistent with the standard-disk model. One possible interpretation is that the emission is from a hot, super-Eddington slim disk Watarai, Mizuno & Mineshige (2001) . Another interpretation is that it is Comptonized emission from a warm, optically-thick corona covering the inner part of the disk Roberts (2007) . A second subgroup of ULXs (including NGC 1365 X1 in 2004) sometimes show a thermal soft excess ( $kT_{\rm in}\approx 0.15$ keV) in addition to the power-law component; but the soft excess contributes only $\lesssim 30$ % of the luminosity Stobbart et al. (2006) . Again, this is not evidence of a canonical high/soft state, which is by definition dominated by the disk. In fact, it is not uncommon also for Galactic BHs in the low/hard state to have a non-dominant soft excess from the truncated outer disk in addition to the hard power-law component Remillard & McClintock (2006) . In summary, although there are two subgroups of ULXs with possible evidence of thermal components in their X-ray spectra, neither case corresponds to the canonical high/soft state.

4.2. A different accretion state or a different class of BHs?

Based on the previous arguments, we propose three possible scenarios to explain the spectral state of hard power-law ULXs, such as X1 and X2, and their variability. The first scenario suggests that these ULXs are intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) in a low/hard state, where the hard power-law spectra are a true characteristic of this state. If all accreting BHs must undergo a transition from a low/hard to a high/soft state at a certain luminosity threshold ($L_{\rm X}\sim$ a few per cent of $L_{\rm Edd}$), then ULXs with hard power-law spectra and luminosities of $\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ would require intermediate-mass BHs with masses of $\gtrsim$ a few $10^{3}M_{\odot}$, as suggested by Winter, Mushotzky, and Reynolds (2006). However, this scenario implies that ULXs represent a distinct physical class of BHs that never transition to the high/soft state due to insufficient accretion rates from their donor stars. Currently, this interpretation is considered the least likely due to the lack of supporting evidence and theoretical justification for such intermediate-mass BHs.

In the super-Eddington state, stellar-mass black holes (BHs) can exhibit a range of characteristics, including power-law ULXs with or without soft excess and convex-spectra ULXs, all of which are varieties of the very high state or super-Eddington regime. This regime is marked by a combination of Compton scattering, photon trapping, slim-disk energy advection, and massive radiation-driven outflows, with possible transitions between substates, as observed in sources like IC 342 X1. The implied BH masses are approximately $10M_{\odot}$, with isotropic X-ray luminosities ranging from $1$ to $30L_{\rm Edd}$ and mass accretion rates of a few to $\sim 1000$. In this scenario, ULXs represent a distinct accretion state of normal stellar-mass BHs, where the accretion rate and luminosity always exceed the Eddington limit, preventing the observation of their canonical high/soft state.

In this scenario, black holes (BHs) in ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have masses ranging from approximately 30 to 100 $M_{\odot}$, placing them at the upper end of the high-mass X-ray binary distribution, with isotropic luminosities ($L_{\rm X}$) between 0.1 and a few times the Eddington limit ($L_{\rm Edd}$). The main observational support for this massive stellar BH scenario stems from the observed decline in the ULX luminosity distribution at $L_{\rm X} \approx 2 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, as noted by Grimm, Gilfanov, and Sunyaev (2003), which can be interpreted as the characteristic Eddington luminosity for the ULX population. This implies that most ULXs have isotropic luminosities below the Eddington limit. Consequently, ULXs must exhibit a different sequence of state transitions compared to Galactic BHs, as they are consistently dominated by Comptonized emission at luminosities below, near, and slightly above Eddington, without transitioning through a "naked-disk" high/soft state. Any direct disk component present is less significant than the Comptonized component, or possibly a slim-disk component in the most luminous sources. This interpretation suggests a continuous range of coronal optical depths and temperatures, with one state able to transition smoothly into another, eliminating the gap between the low/hard and very high states.

4.3. Two-component accretion flows?

We propose that scenario c) is the most consistent with multiband observations, although some ULXs may also exist in the highly super-Eddington state of scenario b). A key distinguishing feature between the two scenarios is the relative change in accretion rate ($\dot{m}$) required to produce a change in luminosity. In scenario c), similar relative changes in $\dot{m}$ can result in luminosity changes between $\sim 0.1$ and $\sim 1L_{\rm Edd}$. In contrast, scenario b) exhibits strong radiative saturation above Eddington, with $L\sim(1+\ln\dot{m})$, meaning that luminosity changes between $\sim 1$ and $\sim 10L_{\rm Edd}$ demand an increase in $\dot{m}$ of several orders of magnitude, potentially constraining the transition mechanism and producing detectable effects on the optical counterpart or outflow density.

Why would ULXs lack a canonical high/soft state? Their BHs would be a few times, or perhaps even an order of magnitude more massive than Galactic BHs—but this should not directly affect their state-transition properties. We suggest that the type of donor stars and the mechanism of mass transfer can cause a different spectral-state behaviour in Galactic BHs and ULXs. The canonical spectral state classification is based mostly on the appearance of Galactic BHs in low-mass X-ray binaries, also known as soft X-ray transients. Instead, the most luminous ULXs are thought to have OB donors, with masses $\gtrsim 10M_{\odot}$ , based on theoretical and observational considerations. Stellar evolution models Rappaport, Podsiadlowski & Pfahl (2005) show that OB stars can provide the required mass transfer rates $\gtrsim 10^{-6}M_{\odot}$ yr \textsuperscript{-1} over their nuclear timescale $\sim 10^{6}$ yr, with a peak as the donor evolves to the blue-supergiant stage. And optical observations of ULX counterparts show that they are indeed predominantly located in OB associations or regions of recent star formation, even though it is always difficult to identify the donor star, and separate the optical contribution of the donor star from that of the irradiated accretion disk Ramsey et al. (2006) . A typical ULX donor star is also likely to be filling its Roche lobe, because the fraction of gas captured by the BH from wind accretion alone may not be sufficient to produce the observed X-ray luminosity. We speculate that ULX donor stars may provide both high-angular-momentum gas, feeding the disk through Roche-lobe overflow, and low-angular-momentum gas, feeding the Comptonizing medium and jet through a sub-Keplerian wind, perhaps enhanced by the X-ray irradiation of the secondary. This would be analogous to the two-flow scenario proposed for some Galactic BHs with massive donors Smith, Heindl & Swank (2002) . In fact, it may not be a coincidence that Cyg X-1, perhaps the closest Galactic analog to a ULX in terms of accretion geometry and donor star, has only rarely been seen in a true high/soft state Dotani et al. (1997) ; instead, most of its state transitions are between the low/hard state (where it spends the majority of its time) and what should be properly labelled as very high state, with radio activity and an X-ray spectrum consisting of a strong power-law plus thermal component Remillard & McClintock (2006) . We note as another possible analogy that the accretion mode of radio galaxies (as indicated by their emission-line type and radio power) may depend on their source of gas (Bondi accretion of the hot gas and/or disk accretion of cold gas), not simply on the total accretion rate Hardcastle, Evans & Croston (2007) .

The arguments presented above provide a qualitative explanation for why Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) can maintain a hard power-law spectrum even at X-ray luminosities of $\sim 0.1$ – $1L_{\rm Edd}$. Another key factor influencing the behavior of ULXs is their high accretion rate, as previously mentioned. For black hole transients to transition into a soft, disk-dominated state during an outburst, the accretion rate $\dot{m}$ must be less than or equal to 1, allowing the accretion flow to settle into a quasi-steady standard-disk configuration. However, if the accretion rate remains persistently above Eddington, this transition is impossible because the inner disk cannot survive at $\dot{m}>1$. We propose that some transient ULXs may bypass the standard disk state altogether, instead transitioning directly from the low/hard state to either the slim-disk state, which produces a convex X-ray spectrum, or the Compton-scattering-dominated very high state, characterized by a cut-off power-law spectrum. In this scenario, the standard disk may only be visible at larger radii, potentially producing the observed cool soft excess, as noted by Roberts (2007). The ability of ULXs to sustain super-Eddington mass transfer rates for extended periods may be attributed to differences in the mass or evolutionary stage of their donor stars compared to those of typical Galactic black hole transients.

4.4. Thresholds for the low/hard state

To make progress on these issues, we need to understand more about the threshold luminosity and accretion rate at which BHs (including Galactic X-ray binaries) switch from the low/hard to the high/soft state, and to determine whether, in some cases, a system can remain in a hard state up to luminosities $\sim 0.1$ – $1L_{\rm Edd}$ , and then evolve directly towards the very high state. The scenario of a universal threshold between low/hard and high/soft state at $\dot{m}\sim 0.01$ works if the low/hard state consists of a radiatively-inefficient, advection-dominated flow Esin, McClintock & Narayan (1997) . Such flow is not expected to survive at higher accretion rates, when radiative cooling becomes more efficient. However, other accretion models may explain the persistence of a hard state up to higher luminosities: for example a “luminous hot accretion flow” Yuan & Zdziarski (2004) may be consistent with hard-state luminosities up to at least $0.1L_{\rm Edd}$ . Further investigations should determine whether the hard state in ULXs (and perhaps in some classes of AGN) can extend to even higher luminosities, if the dominant power-law component is produced by a magnetized corona or a jet, perhaps favored by sub-Keplerian accretion flows. Observationally, low/hard to high/soft transitions during several outbursts of the Galactic BHs GX 339-4 and XTE J1550 $-$ 564 have been seen at different X-ray luminosities, sometimes as high as $\approx 0.1L_{\rm Edd}$ Yu et al. (2007) . The existence of a linear relation between the peak luminosity in the low/hard and high/soft states, and the properties of the time delay between the two states, have been interpreted Yu et al. (2007) as possible evidence of the two-flow accretion geometry (sub-Keplerian flow responsible for the low/hard emission, and Keplerian flow feeding the disk). Hard-state luminosities $\gtrsim 10^{38}$ erg s \textsuperscript{-1} have also been seen in the Galactic BH candidate Cyg X-3 Hjalmarsdotter et al. (2008) , which has a Wolf-Rayet donor with a strong wind. Finally, there is a group of at least 8 Galactic BHs Brocksopp, Bandyopadhyay & Fender (2004) that remain in the low/hard state throughout their outbursts. Understanding why those BHs never switch to the high/soft state will also provide a useful comparison for the ULX behavior.

If our suggestion that ULXs lack a canonical high/soft state is correct, studying their radio behaviour may provide further insight. In accreting black holes, the low/hard state is characterized by a steady jet, marked by flat-spectrum radio-core emission, whereas the high/soft state is radio-quiet due to jet quenching, and the very high state is marked by radio flaring (Fender, Belloni & Gallo, 2004). It would be intriguing to investigate whether black holes that never transition to the high/soft state perpetually have a jet, potentially carrying a substantial fraction of the accretion power, with the only transition being between a steady jet at lower luminosities and a flaring jet at higher luminosities. However, current radio observations lack the sensitivity to detect point-like radio core emission in ULXs or monitor their short-term variability in relation to their X-ray state, although brighter, persistent, extended lobe emission has been identified in some ULXs, taking the form of optically-thin synchrotron nebulae (Miller, Mushotzky & Neff, 2005).
