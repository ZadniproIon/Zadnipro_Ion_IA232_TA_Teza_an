Abstract

We report the synthesis and characterisation of polycrystalline Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} , a layered material in which the Ru \textsuperscript{4+} ( $4d^{4}$ configuration) form a honeycomb lattice. The optimal synthesis condition was found to produce a nearly ordered Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} ( $C2/c$ phase), as assessed from the refinement of the time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal a large temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism ( $\chi_{0}\sim 1.42(2)\times 10^{-3}$ emu/mol Oe) with no evidence of magnetic ordering down to 1.5 K, and with an absence of dynamic magnetic correlations, as evidenced by neutron scattering spectroscopy. The intrinsic susceptibility ( $\chi_{0}$ ) together with the Sommerfeld coeficient of $\gamma=11.7(2)$ mJ/Ru mol K \textsuperscript{2} estimated from heat capacity measurements, gives an enhanced Wilson ratio of $R_{W}\approx 8.9(1)$ , suggesting that magnetic correlations may be present in this material. While transport measurements on pressed pellets show nonmetallic behaviour, photoemission spectrocopy indicate a small but finite density of states at the Fermi energy, suggesting that the bulk material is metallic. Except for resistivity measurements, which may have been compromised by near surface and interface effects, all other probes indicate that Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} is a moderately correlated electron metal. Our results thus stand in contrast to earlier reports that Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} is an antiferromagnetic insulator at low temperatures.

I Introduction

In the realm of scientific inquiry, the systems comprised of heavy $d^{4}$ ions have garnered significant attention. This attention arises from the intricate dance between the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) of intermediate strength (approximately 0.16 eV) and the Coulomb interaction, U. This delicate balance seems to give rise to a plethora of unusual properties, many of which are noteworthy: unconventional superconductivity (12), metal-insulator transitions (13), orbital ordering (5), non-Fermi liquid behavior (16), high-temperature ferromagnetism (18), low-temperature p-wave spin-triplet superconductivity (19), electron nematic behavior (20), quantum criticality (9), and both itinerant ferro and metamagnetism (23). Furthermore, tunnel-type structures such as Rutile, Ramsdellite, and Hollandite have the capacity to host valencies ranging from +2 to +5 (25). The presence of mixed valencies results in a multitude of intriguing phenomena, including charge, spin, and orbital ordering (27). In this context, Na \textsubscript{2.7} Ru \textsubscript{4} O \textsubscript{9}, a material featuring a large tunnel-type structure, emerges as a promising candidate for exploring the interplay between Coulomb interactions and the relatively modest SOC associated with the mixed valence heavy $d^{4}$ ions.

Layered honeycomb structures have been identified as having the potential to host exotic ground states, a well known example of which is the honeycomb iridates A \textsubscript{2} IrO \textsubscript{3} (A=Na, Li). In these Ir \textsuperscript{4+} (5 $d^{5}$ ) materials, the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) stabilises a $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ Mott insulating state. The combination of strong SOC, intrinsic geometric frustration and other competing terms in the Hamiltonian favours highly anisotropic Kitaev exchange interactions Jackeli and Khaliullin (2009) . Theoretical predictions suggest that the Kitaev physics associated with these interactions may lead to exotic phases such as topological insulators Chenet al.(2015) and quantum spin liquid state Kitaev (2006) (QSL). However, such novel ground states have not yet been realized in these systems largely due to competing isotropic interactions (Heisenberg) that stabilize magnetic order and/or lattice distortions that relieve geometrical frustration.

In this context, the study of the honeycomb ruthenate counterparts (A \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} , with A=Na, Li) provides a new path to explore systems with unusual physics emerging from the interplay of SOC and electronic correlations. These materials feature a Ru \textsuperscript{4+} (4 $d^{4}$ ) configuration, which in the presence of a strong octahedral crystal field, and intermediate strength SOC and Hund’s couplings, yields a $t_{2g}^{4}$ ground state manifold with $J_{\rm{eff}}=0$ . For such systems it has recently been proposed that super exchange interactions lead to excitonic Van Vleck-like magnetism, and above a quantum critical point, Bose Einstein condensation of the higher lying $J_{\rm{eff}}=1$ triplet occurs Khaliullin (2013) . The inherent bond-directionality of the $J_{\rm{eff}}$ states, renders the ground state exquisitely sensitive to the lattice connectivity. In the case of the honeycomb lattice it is predicted that a novel type of spin-liquid may be realised Chaloupka and Khaliullin (2019) .

While interest in the honeycomb ruthenates has been largely concentrated in the Li \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} due to the presence of dimerization and the formation of an exotic valence bond liquid phase Miuraet al.(2007) , the studies of the physical properties of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} are somewhat scarce and unclear. Early studies by Mogare et al. Mogareet al.(2004) identified the crystal structure and synthesis conditions of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} , noting that the material suffered from cation disorder within the honeycomb plane. More recently, Cao and co-workers Wanget al.(2014) claimed to synthesise single crystals, determining Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} to be an insulating antiferromagnet with a Néel temperature around 30 K from bulk susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. Subsequently, Gapontsev et. al. Gapontsevet al.(2017) used X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resistivity and density functional theory calculations to propose a model of the magnetic structure in the ground state. In parallel, Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} has been identified as a candidate material for a cathode for sodium batteries Mortemard de Boisseet al.(2016) . It has been demonstrated that it exhibits a remarkably high reversibility of electrochemical Na insertion/deinsertion combined with a high specific capacity Tamaruet al.(2013) . From all these studies, Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} has been identified to crystalise in one of the two existing polymorphs: a disordered-Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} with space group $R\overline{3}m$ Tamaruet al.(2013) and randomly distributed [Na \textsubscript{1/3} Ru \textsubscript{2/3} ]O \textsubscript{2} slabs and an ordered-Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} Mogareet al.(2004) , with space group $C2/c$ (or $C2/m$ ) and honeycomb-ordered [Na \textsubscript{1/3} Ru \textsubscript{2/3} ]O \textsubscript{2} slabs (see Figure 1 for the $C2/c$ crystal structure). Our interest is in the ordered phase , which might be expected to host exotic physics in the context of a $d^{4}$ spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator Chaloupka and Khaliullin (2019) . The purpose of the current study is to revisit the synthesis and characterisation of low-temperature properties to clarify the ground state of the ordered phase of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} . Remarkably, we find no evidence of magnetism in this material, identifying it instead as a paramagnetic, correlated electron metal. We discuss the possible reasons why this material was miscategorized.

II Experiment

The synthesis of polycrystalline Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} consisted of two steps, following similar procedures present in Refs. Mogareet al.(2004) . The first part involved the synthesis of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} , prepared by solid state reaction from stoichiometric amounts of Na \textsubscript{2} O \textsubscript{2} and RuO \textsubscript{2} . The powders were ground and mixed in an agate mortar under argon. The mixture were placed in an alumina crucible and heated to 450 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 5 h, 530 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 10 h and 630 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 20 h under oxygen atmosphere with a temperature rate of 50 \textsuperscript{∘} C/h. The phase composition of the resulting powder was checked using a Rigaku Miniflex 600 x-ray powder diffractometer, with the resulting diffraction pattern showing pure Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} phase. The second step consisted of reducing the Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} under argon flow at 950 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 24 h using a tube furnace. The resulting product was a black homogeneous Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} powder, which was found to be mildly air sensitive. Efforts to make single crystals via flux growth were unsuccessful, due in part to the volatility of the material and the requirement of having a reducing atmosphere to stabilise the Ru \textsuperscript{4+} ion.

In the examination of the crystalline architecture of sodium ruthenate, Na2.7Ru4O9, both intermediate temperature (450 Kelvin) and room temperature (300 Kelvin) synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) techniques were employed, as depicted in Figures 4 (a and b) and further corroborated by powder X-ray diffraction measurements (Figures 4 c and d). At the intermediate phase (450 Kelvin), a solitary super-lattice peak was detected at q1=(0, 1/2, 0), while at the low-temperature (LT) phase (300 Kelvin), two super-lattice peaks arose, namely q1=(0, 1/2, 0) and q2=(0, 1/3, 1/3). The monoclinic space group C2/m of the high-temperature prototype phase was employed to index these super-lattice peaks. Under the group-subgroup relationship, the intermediate q1=(0, 1/2, 0) phase was assigned the P2/m symmetry. The q2=(0, 1/3, 1/3) super-lattice reflection resulted in a substantial expansion of the unit cell volume and a dramatic decrease in symmetry at room temperature. To elucidate the q1=(0, 1/2, 0) super-lattice peak for the intermediate phase at 450 Kelvin, P2/m symmetry was utilized to refine the SC-XRD data under the group-subgroup relationship, utilizing atomic positions from an earlier report on powder samples at room temperature with the C2/m space group, which corresponds to the prototype HT-phase (>630 Kelvin). The room temperature phase's structure with q1=(0, 1/2, 0) and q2=(0, 1/3, 1/3) is more complex. From the observed Laue symmetry, we infer that the space group should be P-bar1, but the abundance of fitting parameters makes this challenging. Consequently, we disregarded the q2=(0, 1/3, 1/3) super-lattice reflections and conducted an average structure analysis with the same unit-cell size and the same space group P2/m of the intermediate phase as an approximant structure. The derived R-factors (RF2) for the intermediate and LT phases were 11.41 and 16.01, respectively (refer to Figures 4 (a and b)). The refined lattice parameters for the prototype HT-phase at 695 Kelvin, the intermediate-phase at 450 Kelvin, and the LT-phase at 300 Kelvin (room temperature) are presented in Table 1.

The crystallographic structure of the ordered Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} was verified by time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction (TOF-NPD) measurements on the WISH instrument at the ISIS spallation neutron source, UK. The powder ( $\sim 3.5$ grams total mass) was finely ground and enclosed in a thin walled cylindrical vanadium can. The obtained powder diffraction patterns collected for temperatures ranging from $T=100$ K to $T=1.5$ K using detector banks 2 - 5 were analyzed by Rietveld refinement as implemented in the TOPAS software (TOPAS 6.0, Bruker AXS, 2017). For each diffraction pattern Chebyshev polynomials of 24th order were used in order to model the complex corrugated background. Structural parameters, like lattice parameters, atomic positions, occupancies, isotropic displacement parameters and sample dependent peak shape contributions were constrained over the different banks. More details about the Rietveld refinement can be found in the Supplemental Material Note (1) .

Bulk characterisation of the powders consisted of magnetic susceptibility ( $\chi$ ) measurements in a Quantum Design superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), heat capacity ( $C_{p}$ ) and four-probe resistance ( $R$ ) measurements in a Quantum Design physical properties measurement system (PPMS). The heat capacity measurement was made on a sintered, cylindrical pellet with specific dimensions to adapt to the mounting on the PPMS addenda, i.e. large surface area and thin sample to enable good thermalisation. The two-tau analysis method was employed and a high coupling constant ( $>$ 90%) was measured at all temperatures demonstrating that the extracted time constant represents the relaxation of the sample with the external thermal reservoir. Furthermore, the relaxation curves were well fitted to the two-tau model and no distortion in the raw relaxation curves was observed. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to investigate the Na:Ru ratio on a representative batch of powders using a JEOL JSM-6610LV with Oxford Instruments EDX. To this end, the powders were pelletized and cleaved to expose fresh surfaces and the measurements were conducted in six different areas of the sample. The measurements gave an average Na:Ru ratio of $\sim 2.11$ , suggesting that the samples are slightly Ru deficient. The deficiency of Ru is likely related to the loss of RuO \textsubscript{2} during the reduction process under argon atmosphere. While an excess of sodium might be present in our samples, due to the flexibility of the structure and as demonstrated studies of battery material Mortemard de Boisseet al.(2016) , the high volatility of Na \textsubscript{2} O at 950 \textsuperscript{∘} C compared to RuO \textsubscript{2} suggests that the excess of sodium in the structure of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} is unlikely to occur.

The photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements reported here were performed with a frequency converted continuous wave laser and a hemispherical electron spectrometer. The photon energy of 6.01 eV used in these experiments provides an increased bulk sensitivity as compared to the more widely used energies of 20-100 eV. The measurements were performed on pressed powders cleaved under ultra high vacuum and the data were collected for temperatures varying between 300 K and 10 K.

The inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed at the time-of-flight chopper spectrometer MARI of the ISIS Facility with incident neutron energies of 180 meV, 15 meV at temperatures of 5 K, 7 K and 300 K. Powder of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} ( $\approx 10$ grams) were wrapped in a thin Al-foil and mounted inside a thin walled Al-can which was cooled down to 5 K inside a top loading closed cycle refrigerator (CCR) with He-exchange gas.

II.1 Powder synthesis

The synthesis of polycrystalline Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} consisted of two steps, following similar procedures present in Refs. Mogareet al.(2004) . The first part involved the synthesis of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} , prepared by solid state reaction from stoichiometric amounts of Na \textsubscript{2} O \textsubscript{2} and RuO \textsubscript{2} . The powders were ground and mixed in an agate mortar under argon. The mixture were placed in an alumina crucible and heated to 450 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 5 h, 530 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 10 h and 630 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 20 h under oxygen atmosphere with a temperature rate of 50 \textsuperscript{∘} C/h. The phase composition of the resulting powder was checked using a Rigaku Miniflex 600 x-ray powder diffractometer, with the resulting diffraction pattern showing pure Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} phase. The second step consisted of reducing the Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} under argon flow at 950 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 24 h using a tube furnace. The resulting product was a black homogeneous Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} powder, which was found to be mildly air sensitive. Efforts to make single crystals via flux growth were unsuccessful, due in part to the volatility of the material and the requirement of having a reducing atmosphere to stabilise the Ru \textsuperscript{4+} ion.

Attempts to synthesize Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} from Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} using other synthesis temperatures and atmospheric conditions were also conducted and are displayed in the phase diagram of Figure 2 . The phase homogeneity of the different batches was verified by powder x-ray diffraction \footnote{ 1 See Supplemental Material at [URL will be inserted by publisher] for further information.} . In general, the optimum conditions for the synthesis of red ordered Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} phase was found to be in the region corresponding to synthesis temperatures between 850 \textsuperscript{∘} C to 1050 \textsuperscript{∘} C and partial oxygen pressure in one bar varying from 0.001% (5N argon atmosphere) to 0.1%. In general, the final structure was sensitive to final synthesis conditions; for example, temperatures above 1050 \textsuperscript{∘} C under argon atmospheric condition produced samples with a high degree of in-plane Ru-Na disorder characterised by an $R\overline{3}m$ space group. On the other hand, for temperatures ranging from 850 \textsuperscript{∘} C to 1050 \textsuperscript{∘} C under the same conditions, the crystal structure of the powders were mostly characterised by the ordered $C2/c$ space group Note (1) . A complete systematic study of the bulk properties of all batches was not performed and is beyond the scope of this study. Note that despite ranges of temperature and partial oxygen pressure having been identified as optimum conditions for the synthesis of ordered Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} (see Figure 2 ), all the samples used in the various experiments reported in this manuscript were prepared by heating Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} under argon flow at 950 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 24 h.

II.2 Characterization methods

The structure of Na2.7Ru4O9, as depicted in Figure 5, is illustrated for both intermediate and low (ambient) temperature phases. The structural parameters derived from single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) refinement are presented in Tables S1 and S2 (SI-2), serving as the basis for the powder high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) structural refinements to validate our structural model. The indexing of all Bragg reflections was achieved by assuming the monoclinic space group P2/m, and the HR-XRD refinement demonstrated an outstanding fit, as demonstrated in Figures 4 (c and d). It is worth mentioning that the super-lattice reflections observed in single crystal experiments are too faint to be discerned in the powder reflection profiles displayed in Figures 4 (c and d).

To elucidate the cause of the phase transition discernible in the electrical resistivity and thermal capacity data, we undertook numerous diffraction experiments on both individual crystal and polycrystalline Na\(_2.7\) Ru\(_4\) O\(_9\) specimens within the temperature span of 300 to 695 K. Remarkably, the SC-XRD results obtained from the temperature variation revealed consecutive phase transitions. In the intermediate-phase, a single super-lattice peak is detectable at q\(_1\) = (0, \(\frac{1}{2}\), 0) at \(T_{\textrm{C1}}\) = 630 K, whereas two super-lattice peaks surface at both q\(_1\) = (0, \(\frac{1}{2}\), 0) and q\(_2\) = (0, \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3}\) ) below \(T_{\textrm{C2}}\) in the LT-phase, as depicted in Fig. 2 (a and b). It is worth noting that these super-lattice peaks were not documented in the previous investigation of powder samples, likely due to their weak reflections.

The photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements reported here were performed with a frequency converted continuous wave laser and a hemispherical electron spectrometer. The photon energy of 6.01 eV used in these experiments provides an increased bulk sensitivity as compared to the more widely used energies of 20-100 eV. The measurements were performed on pressed powders cleaved under ultra high vacuum and the data were collected for temperatures varying between 300 K and 10 K.

The inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed at the time-of-flight chopper spectrometer MARI of the ISIS Facility with incident neutron energies of 180 meV, 15 meV at temperatures of 5 K, 7 K and 300 K. Powder of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} ( $\approx 10$ grams) were wrapped in a thin Al-foil and mounted inside a thin walled Al-can which was cooled down to 5 K inside a top loading closed cycle refrigerator (CCR) with He-exchange gas.

III Results

The structure of Na2.7Ru4O9, as depicted in Figure 5, is presented for both intermediate and low (ambient) temperature phases. The structural parameters derived from SC-XRD refinement are displayed in Tables S1 and S2 (SI-2), serving as the foundation for powder HR-XRD structural refinements to validate our structural model. All Bragg reflections were effectively indexed by assuming a monoclinic space group P2/m. The HR-XRD refinement demonstrated a remarkable fit, as illustrated in Figures 4 (c and d). It is worth noting that super-lattice reflections identified through single-crystal experiments are not discernible in the powder reflection profiles displayed in Figures 4 (c and d) due to their weakness.

Upon heating, the superlattice peak at the reciprocal space point (0, 1/3, 1/3) vanishes, as demonstrated by Figures 2 (b) and (c). The line graph, derived from the temperature-dependent reciprocal image analysis of this particular peak, exhibits a pronounced attenuation of intensity surpassing the critical temperature $T_{\textrm{C2}}$ (Figure 2 (c)). Remarkably, this phenomenon bears a striking resemblance to the behavior observed in sodium-deficient sodium ruthenate (Na\textsubscript{3-x}Ru\textsubscript{4}O\textsubscript{9}), where nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data reveal the sodium ions' sites undergoing averaging motion at 390 Kelvin (above the first-order phase transition). As indicated by reference (34), this motion of the sodium ions was attributed to the ionic motion within the material. Furthermore, above 360 Kelvin, the ordered state undergoes a rapid dissolution, in agreement with our transport measurements. This observation implies a substantial shift in the charge separation patterns within the mixed valence system below and above the dissolution of the ordered state (refer to the section on Crystal-structure analysis).

Figure 4 (a) shows the temperature-dependent magnetic response $\chi(T)$ of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} in an applied magnetic field of 1 T. The data was collected from field cooled powders with total mass of 0.3 grams. No evidence of magnetic ordering is observed in $\chi(T)$ down to 2 K, in contrast with a previous report on single crystals of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} where a sharp antiferromagnetic transition was observed at $T_{N}=30$ K Wanget al.(2014) . No appreciable difference is observed between data collected under zero-field or field cooled conditions. Above 50 K, the magnetic susceptibility is weakly temperature dependent and is likely dominated by the Pauli term. To estimate the intrinsic susceptibility, $\chi_{0}$ , we first fit the paramagnetic upturn below 50 K to a Curie-Weiss law and subtract it from the raw data. Next, we subtract the isotropic core diamagnetism Bain and Berry (2008) ( $\chi_{D}\approx-5.02\times 10^{-5}$ emu/mol). This gives an intrinsic $\chi_{0}\sim 1.42(2)\times 10^{-3}$ emu/mol Oe. The low temperature Curie-Weiss contribution is equivalent to approximately 10% by mass of $S=1$ impurity, the origin of which we discuss later.

Specific heat data shows no sign of a phase transition down to 1.9 K, as displayed in Figure 4 (b). Fitting the low temperature region (1.9 K $\leq T\leq 12$ K) to $C/T=\gamma+\beta T^{2}$ yields an electronic coefficient of $\gamma=11.7(2)$ mJ/Ru mol K \textsuperscript{2} and a phononic contribution of $\beta=0.198(2)$ mJ/Ru mol K \textsuperscript{4} (inset of Fig 4 (b)). The electronic coefficient is comparable to the values found for Sr \textsubscript{2} RhO \textsubscript{4} Perryet al.(2006) and La-doped (Sr \textsubscript{1-x} La \textsubscript{x} ) \textsubscript{3} Ir \textsubscript{2} O \textsubscript{7} Hoganet al.(2015) ( $x\geq 0.05$ ) and suggests that Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} may be a moderately correlated metal. The experimental values of $\chi_{0}$ and $\gamma$ gives a Wilson ratio of $R_{W}\approx 8.9(1)$ , which is much higher than the unity value for a free electron gas. The enhanced value of $R_{W}$ suggests that Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} is near an instability Ikedaet al.(2000) and that it might be regarded as a moderately correlated metal with enhanced spin susceptibility.

The magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) of the poly-crystalline Na \textsubscript{2.7} Ru \textsubscript{4} O \textsubscript{9} was determined across a temperature range of 1.9 K to 400 K under an external field of 0.5 T. The magnetization vs applied field (H) curve was plotted at temperatures of 2 K and 400 K, revealing a linear pattern without hysteresis, up to a maximum field of 7 T. For convenience, we measured magnetization using a large quantity of pulverized powder sample. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (1.9 K to 400 K) of the compound shows constancy from room temperature to 150 K, suggesting Pauli-paramagnetic behavior. This is followed by a Curie-like increase at lower temperatures. Interestingly, the susceptibility curve above room temperature displays a broad hump at the first-order phase transition, which may be attributed to short-range correlations at such high temperatures, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (c).

The heat capacity of the compound sodium ruthenate, specifically Na2.7Ru4O9, was scrutinized over the temperature spectrum from 1.9 Kelvin to 400 Kelvin, as delineated in Figure 1 (b). The specific heat exhibits two pronounced deviations, which can be attributed to an inflection point at TC2 (during cooling) = 345 Kelvin and TC2 (during heating) = 365 Kelvin, as denoted by the dotted lines in Figure 1 (b). The distinctive nature of this peak, deviating from the typical lambda-shaped characteristic, substantiates a first-order transition in the sodium ruthenate compound. The lack of a discernible mark of magnetic ordering in the susceptibility, as portrayed in Figure 1 (c), suggests that a structural transition might be the primary driver behind the observed hysteresis in the resistivity.

The low-temperature heat capacity data can be construed within the framework of the equation C_P = γT + βT^3, where γ symbolizes the electronic specific-heat coefficient and β denotes the phonon contribution to the total specific-heat (32). The presence of a metallic-like electronic contribution to the low-temperature heat capacity was discerned. The electronic contribution to the specific heat (γ) for Na2.7Ru4O9 was calculated to be 26.91 mJ/mol K^2, indicating a substantial contribution from conduction electrons, consistent with the transport measurements. Furthermore, the estimated value of γ for Na2.7Ru4O9 is significantly larger than the free electron value of γ and on par with the values for other ruthenates, such as the ruthenium superconductor Sr2RuO4 (γ = 40 mJ/mol K^2 Ru) and the non-Fermi-liquid compound La4Ru6O19 (γ = 25 mJ/mol K^2 Ru) (19). This sizeable value of γ underscores that the conduction electrons, presumably from the Ru 4 d bands, are highly correlated.

In contrast to all of our other data, the resistance was found to increase substantially on cooling indicating an insulating behaviour, as observed in Figure 6 . These measurements were carried out using a conventional four-probe terminal method on a cold-pressed pellet, which was sintered in argon at 850 \textsuperscript{∘} C for 1 hour to reduce the effects of grain boundaries. The annealing protocol did not degrade the sample, as confirmed by the X-ray diffraction measurements on the resulting pellets.

III.1 Crystal structure

At an intermediate temperature of 450 K and room temperature (300 K), the crystal structure of Na2.7Ru4O9 has been studied using SC-XRD, with findings further confirmed by powder-XRD measurements. The results indicate a single super-lattice peak at the intermediate phase (450 K) with q1 = (0, 1/2, 0), and two super-lattice peaks at the low-temperature (LT) phase (300 K) with q1 = (0, 1/2, 0) and q2 = (0, 1/3, 1/3). These super-lattice peaks can be indexed using the monoclinic space group C2/m of the prototype high-temperature (HT) phase. The q1 = (0, 1/2, 0) super-lattice peak at the intermediate phase is explained by refining the SC-XRD data under the group-subgroup relation, using atomic positions from earlier reports on powder samples at room temperature with the same space group (C2/m). The structure at room temperature is more complex, and the space group is tentatively identified as P1. Due to a high number of fitting parameters, a simplified analysis was performed by ignoring the q2 = (0, 1/3, 1/3) super-lattice reflections and averaging the structure with the same unit-cell size and the same space group (P2/m) as an approximant structure. The R-factors for the intermediate and LT-phases are 11.41 and 16.01, respectively (see Fig. 4 (a and b)). The lattice parameters for the prototype HT-phase at 695 K, the intermediate-phase at 450 K, and the LT-phase at 300 K (room temperature) are presented in Table 1.

To elucidate the genesis of the phase transition discernible in the electrical resistivity and thermal capacity data, we carried out an extensive series of diffraction experiments on both single crystal and polycrystalline Na\(_2\).7Ru\(_4\)O\(_9\) within the temperature spectrum spanning from 300 to 695 Kelvin. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction results reveal a sequence of phase transitions. For instance, a solitary super-lattice peak becomes discernible at q\(_1\) = (0, \(\frac{1}{2}\), 0) within the intermediate-phase (T\(_C1\) ≈ 630 K), while two super-lattice peaks emerge at q\(_1\) = (0, \(\frac{1}{2}\), 0) and q\(_2\) = (0, \(\frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3}\) ) beneath T\(_C2\) in the low-temperature phase, as displayed in Figure 2 (a and b). It is worth noting that these super-lattice peaks had not been documented in the prior research on powder samples, likely due to their weak intensity.

III.2 Bulk properties

The magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) of the compound Na\(_2.7\) Ru\(_4\) O\(_9\) was determined across a temperature range of 1.9 K to 400 K under an applied field of 0.5 T, utilizing a polycrystalline sample as depicted in Fig. 1 (c). The magnetization-applied field ($H$) relationship was assessed at temperatures of 2 K and 400 K, displaying a linear pattern without hysteresis, with a maximum applied field of 7 T. For operational convenience, the magnetization was measured using a substantial quantity of powder sample. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility (1.9 K to 400 K) of the compound shows a constant value from room temperature to 150 K, indicative of Pauli-paramagnetic behavior, which is followed by a Curie-like rise at lower temperatures. Notably, the susceptibility curve above room temperature reveals a broad hump at the first-order phase transition, as shown in Fig. 1 (c). This could be attributed to the short-range correlations present at such high temperatures.

In the temperature range of 1.9 K to 400 K, the heat capacity of Na2.7Ru4O9 was assessed and depicted in Figure 1 (b). The specific heat displays two significant kinks with an inflection point at TC2 (cooling) = 345 K and TC2 (heating) = 365 K, as indicated by the dashed lines in Figure 1 (b). The distinctive peak shape, deviating from the typical lambda-like shape, points toward a first-order transition in Na2.7Ru4O9. The lack of a clear magnetic ordering signal in the susceptibility displayed in Figure 1 (c) suggests that a structural transition is likely responsible for the observed hysteresis in the resistivity.

The low-temperature heat capacity data can be interpreted using the equation:

C_P = γT + βT^3, (1)

where γ is the electronic specific-heat coefficient and β is the phonon contribution to the total specific-heat (32). The presence of a metallic electronic contribution to the low-temperature heat capacity was observed. The electronic contribution to the specific heat (γ) for Na2.7Ru4O9 was calculated to be 26.91 mJ/mol K^2, signifying a substantial contribution from conduction electrons, in agreement with the transport measurements. Furthermore, the estimated value of γ for Na2.7Ru4O9 is significantly larger than the free electron value of γ and is comparable with the values for other ruthenates, such as Sr2RuO4 (γ = 40 mJ/mol K^2 Ru) and La4Ru6O19 (γ = 25 mJ mol K^2 Ru) (19). This substantial value of γ indicates that the conduction electrons, primarily from the Ru 4d bands, are strongly correlated.

No signatures of magnetic excitations of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} were found in the inelastic neutron scattering measurements. The INS powder spectra collected at $T=7$ K and 5 K with two different incident neutron energies, 15 meV and 180 meV, respectively, are shown in Figure 5 (a-b). The color scale represents the observed intensity as a function of energy transfer and momentum transfer ( $|Q|$ ). We note an absence of a continuum of spin excitations at low $|Q|$ and low energy transfer Note (1) . This behavior, characteristic of magnetic frustration, has been the most widely accepted evidence for a QSL state. The build-up of weak intensity at high- $|Q|$ region in Figure 5 (b) comes from the phonon modes that become stronger at higher incident energies.

All the measurements mentioned above are consistent with our results from PES experiments. The inset of Figure 4 (a) shows the Fermi edges of polycrystalline Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} at $T\leq 50$ K with a photon energy of 6 eV. The PES measurements reveal a jump in the photoelectron intensity at the chemical potential, which is indicative of a small but finite density of states at the Fermi energy for all temperatures probed in these experiments. Similar PES experiments with a higher photon energy and correspondingly increased surface sensitivity did not detect any Fermi step. This strongly suggests that the PES data shown in the inset of Figure 4 (a) represent a finite bulk density of states at the chemical potential, consistent with the specific heat measurements. Although not performed in this present study, band structure calculations would be highly desirable to support the metallic nature of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} and to confirm existing calculations available in the materials project database Persson (2016) .

Measurements of electrical resistivity were conducted utilizing a custom-built setup comprising a furnace (300-450K) and a cryostat (3K and below, Oxford). The electrical resistance was determined in a four-point configuration on a stationary sample holder, with silver paint and 25 $\mu$m gold wire used to make contact with the sample. The current was applied at a right angle to the single crystal length, which corresponds to the crystallographic 'b'-axis. Magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ was obtained via a MPMS-SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design). Heat capacity $C_{p}(T)$ measurements were carried out using the commercially available Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design).

IV Discussion

The structural and chemical characterisation of our powders demonstrate that we have synthesised a nearly phase-pure compound of ordered Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} . However, a complete solution of the crystal structure is hindered by the presence of broad diffraction peaks, which are common for A \textsubscript{2} MO \textsubscript{3} (A = Li, Na and M = Ir, Ru) with honeycomb ordered layers, and can be attributed to stacking disorder. Since in these layered materials the crystal grows perpendicular to the layer plane (here, along c-axis), the ordered honeycomb layers can nucleate in different stacking position, creating stacking faults. The deviation from the ideal sequence of honeycomb stacked layers leads to the peculiar triangular Warren-type peak shapes observed in Fig. 3 . While stacking faults can be modeled by Rietveld refinement using combined x-ray diffraction data sets Betteet al.(2017) , our attempts to tackle this problem proved unsuccessful mainly due to the complex background and intrinsic asymmetry of the peak shapes present in the TOF-NPD data. Nevertheless, our TOF-NPD analysis using the two-phase model reveals a high degree of ordering in the structure of our powders and suggests that the $C2/c$ crystal structure is a good candidate for the microstructural modelling of the stacking faults in Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} . Indeed, recent study on sodium-based batteries Mortemard de Boisseet al.(2019) shows that modeling of stacking faults using similar space group ( $C2/m$ ) is possible when using a combined X-ray diffraction data. Finally, the similarity of the phase percentage of the disordered phase ( $\approx$ 6%) and the Curie-Weiss contribution to susceptibility at low temperature ( $\approx$ 10%) leads us to suggest that the disordered phase might be responsible for the magnetic impurities. This is not unreasonable if the intra-plane Ru disorder causes the electrons to localise and contribute $S=1$ moment per Ru \textsuperscript{+4} ion. The small amount of magnetic impurities may also be responsible for the enhanced Wilson ratio and can explain the absence of magnetic excitations in the INS data due to the proximity of a Stoner transition.

The compound sodium ruthenate, Na2.7Ru4O9, exhibits a monoclinic crystal structure with a longitudinal tunnel along the crystallographic b-axis. The structure is composed of one-dimensional zigzag chains of edge-shared RuO6 octahedra, which can be single, double, or triple edge-shared. These zigzag chains are interconnected along the c-axis via corner sharing. This study presents the physical characteristics of the mixed-valence ruthenium compound Na2.7Ru4O9 across a broad temperature range (1.9 K ≤ T ≤ 450 K) using single crystals. The focus is on examining the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of this compound. Noteworthy findings include the maintenance of metallicity during CO behavior in the compound.

The ground state of insulating ruthenates has been under debate in recent years due to the similarity of SOC, Hund’s rule and crystal field energy scales. Traditionally, perovskite ruthenates have been understood by arguing that the octahedral crystal field lifts the degeneracy of the $d$ -orbital manifold and the four $4d$ electrons fill the $t_{2g}$ energy states to generate a low spin $S=1$ moment. However, if one considers the effect of the moderate SOC of the $4d$ electrons, the $t_{2g}$ manifold could behave as a pseudo- $L_{\rm{eff}}=1$ (or $p$ -state) generating a $J_{\rm{eff}}=0$ ground state with an excited state $J_{\rm{eff}}=1$ at an energy $\lambda$ (SOC energy scale) above the ground state, as postulated in Ca \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} Khaliullin (2013) . Hence, one might expect a Van Vleck behaviour in the magnetism, where the mixing of the ground state and excited levels produces a temperature-independent contribution to the susceptibility that might explain the susceptibility of Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} . However, we believe that there are reasons to rule out this scenario in Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} . Firstly, the energy scale of the SOC in ruthenates is between 50 to 100 meV Tamaiet al.(2019) ; yet we do not observe any excited states in the INS data below 150 meV. Although we cannot rule out magnetic excitations at higher energy, which could be probed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering. Secondly, a $J_{\rm{eff}}=0$ state with unquenched orbital angular momentum requires a high symmetry octahedral environment around the Ru \textsuperscript{4+} ion but the Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} has a large octahedra distortion of 7% [ $r_{l}/r_{s}$ , where $r_{l}$ ( $r_{s}$ ) is the longest (shortest) Ru-O bonds], much greater than the Jahn-Teller distortions observed in Ca \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{4} ( $\approx 1.5\%$ at 10 K) Pinciniet al.(2018) . Such a large distortion is far more likely to quench the orbital magnetism within the $t_{2g}$ manifold and stabilise a configuration with a filled $d_{xy}$ orbital and half-filled $d_{yz,zx}$ orbitals, leading to an $S=1$ state in the localised limit.

Finally, the discrepancy between the bulk measurements in our polycrystalline Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} is perhaps most intriguing. Taken together, the susceptibility, heat capacity and the photoemission measurements indicate that this material has a Fermi liquid-like ground state. However, the insulating behaviour in the resistance measurements appears to contradict this hypothesis. We believe that the source of the discrepancy is the transport measurements made on our powder samples. It is a common practice in the community to determine the resistivity of powdered materials using cold or pressed samples and four-terminal d.c. voltage measurements. However, this can often lead to misleading results; resistance measurements on powdered samples contain contributions from two sources: intrinsic and grain boundary (extrinsic) and it is challenging to separate them. The electron hopping between grains can be modelled as a large energy barrier through which the electrons must tunnel, similar to electron motion in a scanning tunnelling microscope. This inter-grain hopping is the origin of the activation-like exponential increase in the resistance as the temperature is lowered and usually dominates over the intrinsic resistance of a grain. Moreover, the grain boundaries will introduce capacitance into the measurement circuit thus, ideally, the complex impedance should be measured as a function of frequency and temperature so that the real part of the intrinsic impedance can be extracted. For a good example, see Ref. Collieret al.(1989) , where the extracted grain boundary resistance in a pressed pellet of UO \textsubscript{2} had an activation-like temperature dependence with a barrier energy of  0.13 eV and the grain boundary resistance was an order of magnitude larger than the observed intrinsic resistance. It is also worth pointing out that for transport measurements on powders, reproducibility is generally poor; each pressed pellet will have a unique grain boundary resistance due to a large number of factors, including porosity, grain stoichiometry, hygroscopicity and air sensitivity. In general, single crystals are the most reliable form on which to measure transport properties and measurements on powders should be treated with caution. For our system, if we neglect the resistivity data set, the simple conclusion is that Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} is a moderately correlated electron metal with modest magnetic enhancements, a conclusion supported by the photoemission spectroscopy experiments.

V Concluding remarks

We have performed a detailed study of the synthesis and characterisation of polycrystalline Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} by using neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering as well as susceptibility, heat capacity and photemission measurements. No sign of magnetic ordering or magnetic frustration is observed down to 1.5 K. Both magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity data indicate characteristics of significant electron correlation, with a large temperature independent Pauli paramagnetism and moderate Sommerfeld coefficient. This is consistent with the observation of a Fermi edge in the PES measurements. In contrast, resistivity measurements show nonmetallic behaviour, which may be attributed to grain boundary effects. Thus, we classify Na \textsubscript{2} RuO \textsubscript{3} as a moderately correlated electron metal.
