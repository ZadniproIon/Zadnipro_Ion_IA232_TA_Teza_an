Abstract

In condensed-matter physics, significant progress has been achieved through precise control over cooling and trapping techniques in atomic systems (1). Similarly, in semiconductors, these advancements offer a deterministic pathway toward exploiting collective quantum phenomena with exciton gases, a goal that has persisted for decades. While long-lived excitons can be cooled to very low temperatures using cryogenic setups, creating confinement potentials has proven to be a formidable challenge. Such control was only recently attained through devices fabricated using highly complex nano-structuring processes (3). In this work, we present an alternative approach that leverages optical excitation to manipulate exciton transport in situ. Our method employs the optically controlled injection and spatial patterning of charges within a field-effect device, enabling the creation of electric field gradients that act as microscopic traps or anti-traps for exciton dipoles. By shaping the spatial profile of a laser excitation, we can realize any desired confinement geometry. Consequently, we have successfully trapped exciton gases in a density regime where quantum correlations are predicted to emerge at our ultra-low bath temperatures (6).

I Introduction

In our experimental setup, a negative bias of \( V_g = -1.4 \, \text{V} \) was applied to the top gate electrode, confining electrons and holes in the bottom and top quantum wells, respectively (see Fig. S1). This configuration results in an indirect ground excitonic transition, where indirect excitons exhibit an electric dipole moment \( \textbf{d} = e\textbf{r} \), oriented perpendicular to the DQW plane. Here, \( e \) represents the electron charge, and \( r \) is the spatial separation between the electron and hole forming the exciton. In this geometry, indirect excitons strongly interact with an externally applied electric field \( \textbf{E} \) through a dipolar interaction \( E_{\text{dip}} \sim -\textbf{d} \cdot \textbf{E} \). The electric field amplitude within the DQW plane is determined by the applied bias \( V_g \) and the heterostructure thickness \( l \), given by \( E = |\textbf{E}| = V_g / l \). Consequently, the exciton dipole moment is determined by varying \( V_g \) while monitoring the photoluminescence emission energy \( E_X \sim E_{\text{dip}} \). As shown in Figure S2, this measurement yielded a variation of \( 25.0 \pm 0.4 \, \text{meV} \cdot \text{V}^{-1} \), which, combined with the device thickness \( l = 420 \, \text{nm} \), gives an exciton dipole moment \( d = |\textbf{d}| = e(10.3 \pm 0.2) \, \text{nm} \). This value aligns well with the DQW's characteristic dimension, where the centers of the two quantum wells are separated by \( 12 \, \text{nm} \), consistent with the expected electric dipole moment.

The investigation involved a field-effect device, schematically depicted in Figure S1, comprising an $n^{+}-i-n^{+}$ heterostructure incorporating a double quantum well (DQW). This DQW consists of two GaAs quantum wells, each 8 nm in width, separated by a 4 nm thick Al\textsubscript{0.33}Ga\textsubscript{0.67}As barrier. The DQW is flanked by two 200 nm thick Al\textsubscript{0.33}Ga\textsubscript{0.67}As spacers. Experimental measurements were conducted by applying a static potential ($V_g$) across the two $n^{+}$-GaAs layers, which function as gate electrodes. These layers were doped with silicon at a concentration of $n_{Si} \sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ cm\textsuperscript{−3}. The top and back gates were 105 nm and 305 nm thick, respectively. The back gate was connected to a metallic contact, created post-etching of the sample, and was grounded. Electrical isolation from the sample holder was achieved via an 800 nm thick undoped GaAs layer containing an AlAs/GaAs superlattice. Additionally, the top contact was a mesa with a 500$\times$500 $\mu$m\textsuperscript{2} aperture, facilitating photoluminescence collection.

Rapid progress has been made in achieving static control over exciton confinement, yet dynamical control of electrostatic traps has seen less advancement. To date, this control has been achieved by leveraging the high impedance of a field-effect device that incorporates a coupled quantum well (CQW), typically by connecting it in parallel with a 50 Ω impedance reference, as demonstrated by Winbowet et al. (2008). When combined with electrical transmission lines, this method ensures that the shape of short electrical pulses is effectively transmitted to an electrostatic trap cooled in a helium cryostat. Consequently, the internal electric field influencing indirect excitons can be modulated within nanoseconds.

In Figure S4, we present the spatially and spectrally resolved emission of indirect excitons confined within a hollow-trap under the same experimental conditions as those described in Figure 3.C. Notably, the photoluminescence observed inside the trap is shifted to higher energies by $\delta E$ compared to the region outside the trap, where the exciton gas is less dense. This energy shift arises from repulsive dipole-dipole interactions between indirect excitons and provides an estimate of the gas density within the trap. Specifically, the mean field energy associated with these repulsive interactions can be expressed as $u_{0}.n_{\mathrm{X}}$, where $u_{0}$ is a constant determined by the DQW geometry and exciton correlations, and $n_{\mathrm{X}}$ represents the exciton density (27). For the experiments shown in Figure S4, $\delta E \approx$ 1.3 meV, corresponding to $n_{\mathrm{X}} \approx$ 5 × 10\textsuperscript{10} cm\textsuperscript{-2} (27).

A field-effect device was mounted on the helium-3 insert of a closed-cycle helium-4 cryostat (Heliox-ACV, Oxford Instruments). Within the cryostat, an aspheric lens featuring a 0.6 numerical aperture was positioned in front of the sample, adjusted via piezoelectric transducers (ML17, MechOnics-Ag). To enhance the microscope's optical resolution, a mechanical coupling was established between the helium-3 insert and the lens-holding assembly. This setup ensures mechanical vibrations remain below 2 microns across frequencies up to approximately 1 kHz, while enabling cooling of the sample to a low temperature of 330 mK. During experiments, the aspheric lens served dual purposes: exciting the semiconductor sample and capturing the emitted photoluminescence. The collected signal was channeled to an imaging spectrograph connected to an intensified CCD camera (Picostar-UF, La Vision). Consequently, the emission of indirect excitons was analyzed with a 2 ns temporal resolution, either spatially or with a spectral resolution of 200 μeV.

II Experimental details

Fig. S4 presents the spatially resolved photoluminescence spectrum obtained along the central axis of the hollow-trap. This dataset was acquired during the same experimental setup used for Fig. 3.C. The white line in the figure illustrates the spatial distribution of the "writing" beam, which is responsible for establishing the trap barriers. The energy shift, denoted as $\delta E \approx 1.3$ meV, corresponds to the emission profile from which the exciton concentration is calculated.

The photoluminescence dynamics following laser excitation clearly indicate the heating caused by the "writing" beam. Specifically, as shown in Fig. S3.D, the time-resolved emission at the "writing" beam position (red) and outside (blue) reveals that the photoluminescence is enhanced by approximately 45% at the end of the "writing" pulse at the laser excitation site, while the enhancement is significantly weaker in regions outside the beam. This nonlinear response corresponds to the collapse of the inner-ring at the end of the laser excitation, indicating effective thermalization of indirect excitons after the "writing" pulse. Consequently, the population of optically active states increases, leading to a sharp rise in photoluminescence emission. Additionally, these measurements reveal the optical lifetime of indirect excitons, as the photoluminescence follows a mono-exponential decay after laser excitation (black line in Fig. S3.D), with a time constant of 138(3) ns.

III Results

In Figures S3.A and S3.B, we illustrate the spectrally and spatially resolved emission of indirect excitons both at the termination (S3.A) and 4 nanoseconds post-termination (S3.B) of a 300 nanosecond "writing" pulse with an intensity of 10 W·cm⁻². During the laser pulse, we observe that the emission intensity within the illuminated area is weaker compared to regions outside the beam. Notably, upon ceasing the laser excitation, the signal at the "writing" beam's focal point becomes significantly stronger (as shown in Figure S3.C). This behavior is indicative of indirect excitons and corresponds to the formation and subsequent collapse of the inner-ring structure. Such observations are consistent with laser-induced heating in the illuminated region.

The energy difference of photoluminescence from indirect excitons, $\Delta E_{X}$, is plotted as a function of gate voltage, $V_{g}$, in Figure S2. These measurements were conducted at a temperature of 350 millikelvin with a weak excitation source (5 mW/cm²) at 790 nm, applied to the double quantum well (DQW) structure. This low excitation intensity was chosen to avoid the photo-injection of free carriers, ensuring accurate observation of exciton behavior.

Figure S3 presents spatially and spectrally resolved emission measurements of indirect excitons under specific conditions. Panels (A) and (B) depict the emission at the termination (A) and 4 nanoseconds following (B) the application of a "writing" pulse characterized by a 6 µm beam waist and a fluence of 10 W/cm². Panel (C) illustrates the temporal evolution of the emission profiles, with solid lines representing the end of the writing pulse and dotted lines showing the state 4 ns afterward, alongside the laser profile indicated in red. Panel (D) examines the photoluminescence dynamics at the writing pulse location (red trace) and outside this region (blue trace), with the black curve representing the best fit to a mono-exponential decay model, yielding a time constant of 138(3) nanoseconds. All experiments were conducted at a temperature of 350 mK.

In our experimental setup, indirect excitons were optically generated using two CW diode lasers (DL-100 from Toptica) operating at 640 nm ("preparation" beam) and 790 nm ("writing" and probe beams). Both lasers were modulated via electro-optic (integrated-optical modulator from JenOptic) and acousto-optic modulators (Crystal Technologies Inc.), synchronized by a pulse sequencer. This configuration enabled the creation of up to four distinct excitation pulses, with rising and falling edges of approximately 2 ns and 5 ns for the electro-optic and acousto-optic switching, respectively. The results presented were obtained using four distinct pulse sequences, summarized in Figure S5.

Figure S5 illustrates the experimental setup, where blue and red pulses represent the "preparation" and "writing" beams, respectively. The green region highlights the specific time window during which both real images and spectrally resolved data were captured.

The spatially resolved photoluminescence spectrum along the hollow-trap's central axis is shown in Fig. S4. These measurements were conducted in the same experimental setup as for Fig. 3.C. The white line indicates the spatial profile of the "writing" beam, which establishes the trap barriers. Here, δE ≈ 1.3 meV represents the energy shift of the emission, from which the exciton concentration is determined.
