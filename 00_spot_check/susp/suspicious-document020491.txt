Abstract

The research presented in this paper focuses on analyzing the high-resolution SiO(v=0,J=2-1) emission emanating from the nucleus of NGC 253, a galaxy distinguished by its highly inclined barred structure and classified as an archetypal nuclear starburst. With an infrared luminosity of approximately 1.6 × 10¹⁰ L⊙, the galaxy's luminosity is predominantly attributed to the region within 300 pc, as previously documented (Telesco and Harper 1980). Observational data, including infrared spectra (Telesco and Harper 1980; Engelbracht et al 1998) and centimeter-wavelength radio continuum observations (Antonucci and Ulvestad 1988, Ulvestad and Antonucci 1991), corroborate the starburst phenomenon. Additionally, evidence of a large-scale outflow of hot gas perpendicular to the galactic plane, likely driven by intensive star formation, has been reported (Fabbiano and Trinchieri 1984, McCarthy et al 1987, Schulz and Wegner 1992). The substantial molecular gas mass in the nucleus, estimated at ~2–3 × 10⁸ M⊙ (Canzian et al 1988; Mauersberger et al 1996), aligns with the high star formation rate (SFR). Furthermore, water maser emission detected by Ho et al (1987) underscores the active star formation processes within the galaxy.

The morphological influence of the galaxy's barred potential, first identified in K-band imagery by Scoville et al (1985), is hypothesized to have facilitated the inward transport of gas, contributing to the dense molecular environment in the nucleus. Previous studies have produced interferometric maps of the molecular gas distribution in NGC 253's nucleus, encompassing species such as CO (Canzian et al 1988), HCN (Paglione et al 1995), CN (Hüttemeister and Aalto 1998), HCO⁺ (Carlstrom et al 1990), OH (Turner 1985), H₂CO (Baan et al 1997), and CS (Peng et al 1996). However, prior to this work, no high-resolution observations of the dense gas (n(H₂) > 10⁵ cm⁻³) utilizing an optically thin tracer had been achieved. To address this gap, the study employs simultaneous observations in the J=1–0 line of H¹³CO⁺, a tracer of dense gas with minimal opacity. The analysis proceeds by examining the variation of the integrated intensity ratio I(SiO)/I(H¹³CO⁺) across the nuclear region, which provides insights into the spatial distribution of SiO's absolute abundance.

The extended emission from SiO and H¹³CO⁺ is observed in the nucleus of NGC 253. Most of the SiO/H¹³CO⁺ emission originates from a (600 pc × 250 pc) circumnuclear disk (CND) exhibiting a double-ringed structure. The inner ring, with a radius of r ≈ 60 pc (4″), is viewed edge-on along PA=51° and houses the nuclear starburst activity. The outer pseudo-ring extends outward as a spiral-like arc up to r ≈ 300 pc (20″). The gaseous disk's kinematics, marked by significant non-circular motions, is explained as the resonant response of gas to the barred potential. The inner ring corresponds to the inner Inner Lindblad Resonance (iILR), while the outer region is associated with the onset of a trailing spiral wave across the outer ILR (oILR). This configuration accounts for the distinct morphological features observed in different molecular maps.

Results. The galaxy has an outflow morphology in radio continuum, spatially coincident with the CO and H $\alpha$ emission, and centered slightly off the radio continuum peak at the LINER nucleus. The total molecular gas mass in the center is about 7 $\times 10^{8}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ , using a CO luminosity to total molecular gas conversion factor that is three times lower than the standard one. \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission is found near the boundaries of the radio continuum emission cone. The outflow has a projected expansion velocity of 25 km s \textsuperscript{-1} relative to the systemic velocity of NGC 6764. About $4\times 10^{6}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ of molecular gas is detected in the outflow. The approximate location ( $\sim$ 1 kpc) of the dynamical inner Lindblad resonance has been derived from the rotation curve. The peak of the CO emission is slightly ( $<200$ pc) offset from the peak of the radio continuum.

Three distinct regions in the nuclear area of NGC 253 have been identified through morphological, kinematical, and chemical analyses. Region I is the primary source of global SiO emission and is linked to an extensive starburst spanning approximately 150 pc. Its ring-like structure suggests a dynamic response near the inner ILR (iILR) of the galaxy's bar. The SiO abundance in this region (X(SiO) ~ 1–2 × 10⁻¹⁰) is notably higher than typical PDR values (X(SiO-PDR) ~ 10⁻¹¹). Region II extends to the edge of the map (r ~ 300 pc or 20"), exhibiting a spiral-like pattern also seen in other high-density tracers. The molecular gas's distribution and kinematics here are indicative of the bar's outer ILR (oILR). This region coincides with strong non-circular motions (Δv ~ 50–100 km s⁻¹) and an elevated SiO abundance (X(SiO) ~ a few 10⁻⁹). The third region corresponds to the molecular component of the nuclear gas outflow observed in X-ray and optical lines, identified as a dust chimney. Two filaments (N and S) emerge perpendicular to the galactic plane from r ± 60 pc, near an interface where gas is entrained by the outflow. This region also shows a correlation between high-velocity gas (Δv ~ 100–150 km s⁻¹) and enhanced SiO abundance (X(SiO) > 3–5 × 10⁻¹⁰).

1 Introduction

The nuclear region surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) often has the highest level of molecular gas concentration and star formation in galaxies. The processes that drive the excitation and kinematics of the circumnuclear gas, namely, the abundant star formation and the jets and photoionisation associated with the AGN, influence the circumnuclear gas in several ways. The onset and shutdown of the starburst are driven by the properties of the molecular gas, including its density and velocity dispersion, by gravitational instabilities (e.g., Combes 2001), and by processes that tend to prevent star formation, such as the local tidal field (Launhardt, Zylka & Mezger 2002), starburst feedback (e.g., Dopita 1985, Scalo & Chapell 1999), gas consumption (e.g., Franceschini et al. 1998), and tidal shear (e.g., Kenney et al. 1993). Fueling of starbursts is facilitated by nonaxisymmetric components such as bars, and by tidal torques from interactions and mergers (e.g. Combes & Gerin 1985, Athanassoula 1992, Mihos & Hernquist 1994, Laine et al. 2002)

The SiO molecule stands out as a unique tracer of high-density gas in spiral galaxies, with its chemistry remaining largely enigmatic. Observational studies of SiO clouds reveal a significant variation in its relative abundance, spanning over five orders of magnitude (with X(SiO) ranging from <10\textsuperscript{-12} to 10\textsuperscript{-7}). In quiescent dark clouds, SiO emission is virtually absent, corresponding to a low abundance of X(SiO) ~ a few 10\textsuperscript{-12}, indicating substantial grain depletion (Ziurys et al 1989). Conversely, SiO is significantly enhanced in the dense, hot gas within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) forming massive stars, particularly in association with bipolar outflows, where X(SiO) reaches 10\textsuperscript{-7} - 10\textsuperscript{-8} (Martín-Pintado et al 1992, Schilke et al 1997, Gueth et al 1998). This enrichment is attributed to shock chemistry, where SiO is released into the gas phase via grain sputtering by fast shocks. At lower abundances (X(SiO) ~ 10\textsuperscript{-11} - 10\textsuperscript{-10}), SiO is predicted to exist in photon-dominated regions (PDRs), where molecular gas is heated by UV photons from OB associations (Janssen et al 1995, Walmsley et al 1999). Additionally, SiO emission has been detected in molecular clouds near the Galactic Center, with X(SiO) ~ 10\textsuperscript{-8} - 10\textsuperscript{-9} (Martín-Pintado et al 1997, Hüttemeister et al 1998). Notably, these clouds exhibit little evidence of recent star formation, suggesting that the observed emission may be linked to large-scale shocks rather than stellar processes. Such shocks could be driven by the Galactic bar or localized phenomena like superbubbles and supernova remnants.

The nuclear starburst leads to the formation of OB associations or super star clusters, from which the massive stars, through strong supersonic stellar winds, inject both energy and mass into the surrounding interstellar medium. The formation of an expanding starburst “superbubble” will be accompanied by extended X-ray emission from hot gas, and optical H $\alpha$ line emission from the cooler shell. The superbubble that has a larger internal ISM pressure than its surroundings expands into the low-pressure halo ISM until the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, which disrupt the superbubble and allow the hot gas to escape in the form of a galactic wind, as is seen, e.g., in M82 (Strickland, Ponman & Stevens 1997). The cold molecular gas is expected to be compressed around the superbubble into an expanding cocoon.

Molecular gas in outflows has been detected in a few galaxies. M82 has an outflow bubble expanding at 45 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (Weiß et al. 1999), with a molecular outflow gas mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ . NGC 2782 harbors an outflow with about $\sim 2\times 10^{7}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ of molecular gas (Jogee et al. 1998). The outflow in NGC 2782 appears to be in the early stages (its age is $\sim 4\times 10^{6}$ years), so that it is seen before the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. In NGC 3079 four expanding CO shells have been identified (Irwin & Sofue 1996). These appear to have originated from a single starburst that took place a few Myrs ago.

The behavior of the molecular gas in such energetic outflows is still poorly understood. The kinematic and potential energies of the molecular gas are part of the total energy budget of the outflow, and one can use the observed properties of the gas (its location, mass and velocity) to constrain the origin of the outflow. Recently Sakamoto et al. (2006) observed molecular gas shells with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in the circumnuclear disk of NGC 253. Further constraints on the nature and location of the energy source can be provided by the current gas phase, as in NGC 2782 (Jogee et al. 1998), or an unusual geometry of the outflow, such as the off-center outflow in NGC 5775 (Lee et al. 2001). Since gas is fuel for star formation, when it falls back onto the galaxy disk it may induce new episodes of star formation (e.g., Norman & Ikeuchi 1989).

NGC 6764 is a barred spiral with an optically classified low-ionisation nuclear emission-line region (LINER) nucleus (Osterbrock & Cohen 1982). This nearby active galaxy (D=32 Mpc; 1″ = 160 pc) hosts a very young nuclear starburst as shown by its Wolf–Rayet (W-R) feature at 0.47 $\mu$ m (HeII; Schinnerer et al. 2000). Eckart et al. (1991, 1996) and Schinnerer et al. (2000) analyzed the central starburst, traced by the W–R emission, in great detail. The millimetre observations have revealed a central concentration of molecular gas which also emits near-infrared line emission. The 2.12 $\mu$ m H \textsubscript{2} line has features that are also seen in radio continuum. A population synthesis model based on NIR spectral lines suggests that NGC 6764 has undergone two recent starbursts. One of them took place 3–5 Myr ago, producing W–R features, and another 15–50 Myr ago. ROSAT X-ray data trace mainly the central AGN which varies by a factor of two over seven days (Schinnerer et al. 2000). By studying HCN and CO emission in the center of NGC 6764, Kohno et al. (2001) classified this galaxy as a combined AGN/starburst, based on the high HCN/CO line ratio ( $\sim 0.7$ ) in the nucleus which suggests the presence of nuclear activity. Recently Hota & Saikia (2006, hereafter HS06 ) presented GMRT+VLA radiocontinuum and HI observations together with H $\alpha$ data of the galaxy NGC 6764 where they found bipolar radio bubbles along the minor axis together with a compact core. Their HI observations reveal two peaks of emission at the ends of the bar and a depletion in the center together an HI absorption towards the radio core. The coexistence of an AGN and a starburst nucleus in NGC 6764 makes this galaxy an ideal target for studying the influence of both processes.

We present new high spatial resolution observations of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) lines made with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI \footnote{ 1 Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. IRAM is operated by CNRS (France), the MPG (Germany) and the IGN (Spain).} ). We also present high resolution VLA \footnote{ 2 The VLA is a research facility of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), which is operated by Associated Universities Inc., under contract with the National Science Foundation.} radio continuum maps at 3.5 cm and 20 cm (Laine et al. 2006). We describe our observations in §2. In §3 we discuss the thermal and synchrotron emission associated with the hot ISM, and their connection to the nuclear star formation. The distribution, kinematics, physical properties, and mass of the molecular gas in the outflow in NGC 6764 are described in §4. The energies involved in the outflow as determined by the molecular gas and radio continuum observations of the outflow are addressed in §5. We discuss our results in §6 and summarize them in §7. Throughout this paper, we use the following cosmological parameters: $H_{0}=75\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{km\leavevmode\nobreak\ s${}^{-1}$}$ , $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7$ and $\Omega_{b}=0.3$

2 Observations and data reduction

Cleaned maps were derived from visibilities using the standard IRAM package. Each map had dimensions of $256\times 256$ pixels, with a pixel size of $0.4^{\prime\prime}$. The synthesized beam, determined by Gaussian fitting of the dirty beam, measures $7.5^{\prime\prime}\times 2.6^{\prime\prime}$ and is oriented north-south (PA=180°). Due to the galaxy's low declination, the uv plane exhibits unequal sampling, with maximum spacings of 70 m in the north-south direction and 250 m in the east-west. The east-west linear scale at the source distance, assuming $D=3.4$ Mpc (Sandage and Tammann 1975), corresponds to 42 pc. A continuum map was generated by averaging visibilities over a bandwidth free of line emission. Specifically, spectral channels were selected with velocities 200 km s\textsuperscript{-1} above and below the galaxy's systemic velocity. For the effective 235 MHz bandwidth used, the one $\sigma$ point source sensitivity limit was determined to be 0.44 mJy/beam. The rms noise level in 5 MHz-wide channel maps, derived from dirty maps after continuum subtraction, is 2 mJy/beam. This equates to an rms brightness temperature of 17 mK for the synthesized beam size and aligns with a total on-source integration time of 15 hours and a mean system temperature of 150 K.

The \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) lines were observed with the IRAM interferometer (see Table 2 ), located on the Plateau de Bure (France), in the B and C configurations of the array, in 1998. We calibrated the visibilities using the radio galaxy 3C 380 as an amplitude calibrator and 1823+568 and 3C 380 as phase references. The Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) was phase-centered at $\alpha_{J2000}$ =19:08:16.370 and $\delta_{J2000}$ =+50:55:59.58. The velocity resolution was set at 10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} for the two CO transitions, and the CLEANed maps have been restored with a synthesized beam of $2\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}0\times 1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}6$ [P.A.=7 \textsuperscript{∘} ; \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) ], and $1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}25\times 1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}25$ [P.A.=0 \textsuperscript{∘} ; \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) ]. The rms noise for the channel maps is 2 mJy beam \textsuperscript{-1} [58 mK; \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) ], and 5.5 mJy beam \textsuperscript{-1} [82.5 mK; \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) ]. Hereafter the velocity reference is fixed to 2400 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , giving a redshifted frequency of 114.3489 GHz for the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) observations, and 228.6932 GHz for the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) observations.

The total integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) flux is 225 Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} in the 55″ beam of the NRAO 12-m telescope (Sanders & Mirabel 1985). Our PdBI \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) observations detected a total flux of 112 Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} , i.e., filtering out about 50% of the total flux, assuming all the emission is concentrated in the 45″ primary beam of the PdBI. This implies that a large fraction of the molecular gas must be in an extended smooth component to which the interferometer is insensitive. From Eckart et al. (1991) we estimate with IRAM-30m observations the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) integrated intensity to be $\sim 480$ Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} in the center of NGC 6764, which implies a filtering of about 65% of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) flux by the PdBI observations.

The integrated intensity maps for the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) emission lines are shown in Figure 2 . The position of the CO emission peak $\alpha_{CO}(J2000)\leavevmode\nobreak\ =\leavevmode\nobreak\$ 19:08:16.402, $\delta_{CO}(J2000)\leavevmode\nobreak\ =\leavevmode\nobreak\$ 50:56:0.29 has been estimated using the higher spatial resolution of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) transition. Assuming that the spiral arms are trailing, and noting that the receding velocities in the disk are on the eastern side of NGC 6764, the northern side of the galaxy disk is closer to us.

2.1 Radio continuum data

The radio continuum data were obtained with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 3.5 and 20 cm in C and A configurations (see Figure 1 ), respectively. We obtained a comparable spatial resolution at the two observed wavelengths, $1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}39\times 1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}26$ (P.A.= $-45$ \textsuperscript{∘} ) at 20 cm and $2\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}50\times 2\arcsec$ (P.A.=15.5 \textsuperscript{∘} ) at 3.5 cm. For further details about the radio continuum observations, see Laine et al. (2006). The peak position of the 20 cm emission, $\alpha_{20cm}(J2000)$ = 19:08:16.316, $\delta_{20cm}(J2000)$ = 50:55:59.37, was determined to an accuracy better than 0 $\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}$ 1, by filtering out large spatial frequencies, using a wavelet transformation (e.g., Leon et al. 2000), and fitting a Gaussian to the remaining emission.

2.2 CO data

The \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) lines were observed with the IRAM interferometer (see Table 2 ), located on the Plateau de Bure (France), in the B and C configurations of the array, in 1998. We calibrated the visibilities using the radio galaxy 3C 380 as an amplitude calibrator and 1823+568 and 3C 380 as phase references. The Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) was phase-centered at $\alpha_{J2000}$ =19:08:16.370 and $\delta_{J2000}$ =+50:55:59.58. The velocity resolution was set at 10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} for the two CO transitions, and the CLEANed maps have been restored with a synthesized beam of $2\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}0\times 1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}6$ [P.A.=7 \textsuperscript{∘} ; \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) ], and $1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}25\times 1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}25$ [P.A.=0 \textsuperscript{∘} ; \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) ]. The rms noise for the channel maps is 2 mJy beam \textsuperscript{-1} [58 mK; \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) ], and 5.5 mJy beam \textsuperscript{-1} [82.5 mK; \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) ]. Hereafter the velocity reference is fixed to 2400 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , giving a redshifted frequency of 114.3489 GHz for the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) observations, and 228.6932 GHz for the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) observations.

The total integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) flux is 225 Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} in the 55″ beam of the NRAO 12-m telescope (Sanders & Mirabel 1985). Our PdBI \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) observations detected a total flux of 112 Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} , i.e., filtering out about 50% of the total flux, assuming all the emission is concentrated in the 45″ primary beam of the PdBI. This implies that a large fraction of the molecular gas must be in an extended smooth component to which the interferometer is insensitive. From Eckart et al. (1991) we estimate with IRAM-30m observations the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) integrated intensity to be $\sim 480$ Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} in the center of NGC 6764, which implies a filtering of about 65% of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) flux by the PdBI observations.

The integrated intensity maps for the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) emission lines are shown in Figure 2 . The position of the CO emission peak $\alpha_{CO}(J2000)\leavevmode\nobreak\ =\leavevmode\nobreak\$ 19:08:16.402, $\delta_{CO}(J2000)\leavevmode\nobreak\ =\leavevmode\nobreak\$ 50:56:0.29 has been estimated using the higher spatial resolution of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) transition. Assuming that the spiral arms are trailing, and noting that the receding velocities in the disk are on the eastern side of NGC 6764, the northern side of the galaxy disk is closer to us.

3 Thermal and synchrotron emission

The 3mm continuum emission contours are presented in Figure 1a. Despite its compact nature, this continuum source, characterized by a peak flux of 70mJy/beam, is resolved by our beam. Approximately 80% of the flux originates from the central source, which has a deconvolved size of ∼8 × 4.3 arcseconds, aligned with the disk's major axis (PA ∼ 50°). The integrated flux is measured to be 0.250 ± 0.008 Jy. By extrapolating the fluxes at 6cm and 2cm (Turner and Ho 1983), we estimate that nonthermal and thermal free-free emissions each contribute one-third of the observed 3mm continuum flux, with the remaining third attributed to dust emission. While our integrated flux value aligns within the error range with the measurement at 85GHz by Carlstrom et al. (1990; 0.300 ± 0.050 Jy), it is slightly lower than the value derived by P96 at 98GHz (0.320 ± 0.030 Jy).

An H $\alpha$ image of NGC 6764 was kindly given to us by D. Frayer. The observations were done at the Palomar 60-inch telescope with a seeing of 1–3″, using the X-filter centered at 6616 $\AA$ with a width of 20 $\AA$ , leaving out most of the [NII] emission line. Figure 3 shows the H $\alpha$ emission at the center of NGC 6764. Apart from the most intense H $\alpha$ emission in the central region, two other regions of emission are seen near the tip of the bar, which also lies near the beginning of the spiral arms. The most striking characteristic of the H $\alpha$ emission near the center of NGC 6764 is its bubble-like shape, but its size is smaller than the size of the radio continuum outflow feature in the south. In Figure 4 a 4″ spur is observed to the southeast of the location of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) peak, bending towards south. This spur is spatially correlated with faint ( $<6\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{Jy\leavevmode\nobreak\ beam${}^{-1}$}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{km\leavevmode\nobreak\ s${}^{-1}$}$ ) \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) emission.

In Figure 5 the H $\alpha$ emission is compared with the radio continuum spectral index. The “hot spot” in the bubble cavity with a flat spectral index ( $\alpha\sim-0.2$ ) is associated with H $\alpha$ emission driven by the nuclear starburst. Similarly, the tip of the southeastern H $\alpha$ emission spur coincides with a small “hot spot” that has a flat spectrum.

The existence of a massive gas outflow in the central region of NGC 253 is well-supported by observational evidence. Initial discoveries of an ionized gas outflow were reported by Demoulin and Burbidge (1970) and Ulrich (1978), based on H $\alpha$ spectroscopy analysis of gas kinematics. Subsequent detection of soft X-ray emission from the outflow by Fabbiano and Trinchieri (1984) revealed that the X-ray nebula extends predominantly along the southern side of the galaxy's minor axis. This emission was interpreted as thermal radiation from gas heated by fast shocks generated by a starburst-driven bipolar wind. Supporting this interpretation, McCarthy et al. (1987) observed that the ionized gas in the outflow forms filaments adjacent to the X-ray nebula. Additionally, Schulz and Wegner (1992) identified line-splitting in N II, S II, and H II, consistent with ionized gas positioned across the conical boundary of the X-ray nebula. These observations suggest that gas entrainment by the hot wind leads to shock-heating and subsequent emission. The observed line-splitting, along with estimated expansion velocities (~390 km s\textsuperscript{-1}), provide strong evidence for the shock-heating mechanism.

The total FIR luminosity is computed for the whole galaxy from the 60 and 100 $\mu$ m IRAS fluxes (see Table 1 ), but is very close to the bolometric value $L_{bol}=9\times 10^{9}$ $L_{\odot}$ computed for the nuclear region by Schinnerer et al (2000). Following Condon (1992), the star formation rate (SFR) for massive stars is $SFR\leavevmode\nobreak\ (M>5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{$\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$})=9.1\times 10^{-11}(L_{FIR}/L_{\odot})$ , which gives a SFR of 1 $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ /yr. 
 The H $\alpha$ line is mainly emitted by HII regions where newborn massive stars are ionizing the gas. The total H $\alpha$ flux can be used as a tracer of the star formation rate (Kennicutt 1998): 
 $\mbox{L(H}\alpha)(erg/s)=1.26\times 10^{41}SFR(\mbox{$\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$}/yr)$ The H $\alpha$ flux is 1.3 10 \textsuperscript{41} erg/s for the nuclear starburst for an aperture size of 3″(see Table 3 ), which gives a SFR of 1 $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ /yr, consistent with the SFR derived from the FIR luminosity. These two derivations of the SFR take into account only massive stars. Including all stellar masses, and accounting for the effects of optical extinction, Eckart et al. (1991) derived a SFR of 4 $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ /yr for the nuclear starburst (NSB), and a supernova rate of $1.2\times 10^{-2}$ /yr.

While the radio continuum emission at long wavelengths is mainly produced by the compact source (AGN) the contribution from the NSB is important at 3.5 cm creating a flatter spectrum. By fitting the radio continuum between 6 cm and 80 cm where the non-thermal contribution is dominant, we found a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.46$ . Extrapolating that fit down to 3.5 cm, we obtained a non-thermal flux density of 6 mJy, which is much below the measured value of 31 mJy.

The free-free contribution (“bremsstrahlung”) can be computed from the H $\alpha$ flux. The Balmer lines provide an estimate of the number of ionizing photons present in the source. If the optical extinction is known, the H $\alpha$ flux can be used to compute the thermal radio continuum flux (e.g., Caplan & Deharveng 1986). Assuming an electron temperature of $10^{4}$ K and an optical extinction of $A_{V}=4$ (Eckart et al. 1991), the thermal radio continuum flux density at 3.5 cm is 14.8 mJy, obtained by integrating the H $\alpha$ luminosity in the outflow. The H $\alpha$ extinction is given by $A_{H\alpha}=0.605*A_{V}$ . Figure 6 shows the ratio between the radio flux density (mJy) and the H $\alpha$ luminosity (in units of $10^{40}$ erg/s) for the thermal (free–free) contribution versus wavelength. This ratio is 75% at 3.5 cm. The maximum thermal contribution to the flux density at 3.5 cm is thus about 23 mJy (Zurita et al. 2000) which is consistent with our previous estimation of 6 mJy for the non-thermal radiocontinuum.

Table 4 gives an estimate of the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the observed radio continuum emission, using the H $\alpha$ luminosities to estimate the thermal component. At 20 cm the radio continuum emission is mainly non-thermal (87 %), but at shorter wavelengths (6 and 3.5 cm) both contributions are comparable.

3.1 Radio continuum

The total integrated 20 cm flux density from the VLA observations is 90 mJy, which compared to the single dish flux density of 133 mJy (White & Becker 1992), implies that $\sim$ 70% of the total flux density is recovered by the VLA observations. The total 3.5 cm flux density is 31 mJy. Both VLA maps at 20 and 3.5 cm present the same features with a better spatial resolution at 20 cm (see Fig. 1 ). A bright peak is observed towards the nucleus of NGC 6764. Two 5″ spurs emerge from the unresolved nucleus, towards the south and the south-east. The emission near the nucleus is not consistent with a just a nuclear point source but hints at the presence of a nuclear radio jet, as proposed by HS06 . The most remarkable feature is the shell-like emission, at both wavelengths, centered on the central peak with its major axis perpendicular to the major axis of NGC 6764 and extending about 1 kpc above and below the disk plane of the highly inclined galaxy NGC 6764. The clumpy shell emission is brighter towards south than towards north. These radio bubbles were previously reported by Baum et al. (1993), HS06 and Laine et al. (2006).

3.2 H $\alpha$ emission

An H $\alpha$ image of NGC 6764 was kindly given to us by D. Frayer. The observations were done at the Palomar 60-inch telescope with a seeing of 1–3″, using the X-filter centered at 6616 $\AA$ with a width of 20 $\AA$ , leaving out most of the [NII] emission line. Figure 3 shows the H $\alpha$ emission at the center of NGC 6764. Apart from the most intense H $\alpha$ emission in the central region, two other regions of emission are seen near the tip of the bar, which also lies near the beginning of the spiral arms. The most striking characteristic of the H $\alpha$ emission near the center of NGC 6764 is its bubble-like shape, but its size is smaller than the size of the radio continuum outflow feature in the south. In Figure 4 a 4″ spur is observed to the southeast of the location of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) peak, bending towards south. This spur is spatially correlated with faint ( $<6\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{Jy\leavevmode\nobreak\ beam${}^{-1}$}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{km\leavevmode\nobreak\ s${}^{-1}$}$ ) \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) emission.

In Figure 5 the H $\alpha$ emission is compared with the radio continuum spectral index. The “hot spot” in the bubble cavity with a flat spectral index ( $\alpha\sim-0.2$ ) is associated with H $\alpha$ emission driven by the nuclear starburst. Similarly, the tip of the southeastern H $\alpha$ emission spur coincides with a small “hot spot” that has a flat spectrum.

3.3 Nuclear star formation

The detection of SiO emission in NGC 253 was first reported by Mauersberger and Henkel in 1991. Subsequent work by Sage and Ziurys (1995) identified J=2–1 SiO emission in multiple starburst galaxies, including NGC 253. Their findings suggested that the I(SiO)/I(N \textsubscript{2} H+) ratio could serve as an indicator of the star formation rate (SFR) per unit mass. However, their conclusions regarding the origin of SiO emission were limited by low-resolution observations of a single transition. To investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of SiO clouds, we conducted a mapping study of the J=5–4, 3–2, and 2–1 SiO transitions in the nuclei of three starburst galaxies: M 82, NGC 253, and IC 342 (as detailed in Martín-Pintado et al. 1999, hereafter MP99). Initial results from our survey, carried out using the 30m telescope, highlighted the varying impact of star formation across these galaxies. Specifically, inferred SiO abundances differed significantly among the galaxies (ranging from X(SiO) $\sim$ 10 \textsuperscript{-8} in IC 342 to $\sim$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10} in M 82), with no apparent correlation to variations in the SFR per unit mass. Additionally, the physical conditions of SiO clouds, derived from transition ratios, exhibited marked differences across our sample.

3.3.1 Star formation rate

Column 5 of Table 1 presents the variation in X(SiO) within the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) of NGC 253. The derived values indicate X(SiO) $\sim$ 1–2 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10} for the central region and starburst ring I, X(SiO) $\sim$ 3–15 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10} for region II, and X(SiO) $\sim$ 3–5 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10} for the outflow. The average global abundance of SiO in the CND is approximately X(SiO) $\sim$ 1.5 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10}, which is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the typical value observed in Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) (Janssen et al., 1995; Walmsley et al., 1999). Notably, the highest abundance of X(SiO) is found in the outer region II, where chemical processing of the gas influenced by the nuclear starburst activity (primarily associated with region I) is expected to be minimal. Additionally, the SiO abundance is significantly elevated in the outflow, which is likely driven by the starburst activity but not directly associated with it. This finding underscores that SiO emission is not exclusively tied to dense gas in areas of recent star formation, suggesting that alternative mechanisms must be explored to explain the distinct chemical processing of molecular gas within the nuclear environment.

3.3.2 (Non-)Thermal radiocontinuum

While the radio continuum emission at long wavelengths is mainly produced by the compact source (AGN) the contribution from the NSB is important at 3.5 cm creating a flatter spectrum. By fitting the radio continuum between 6 cm and 80 cm where the non-thermal contribution is dominant, we found a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.46$ . Extrapolating that fit down to 3.5 cm, we obtained a non-thermal flux density of 6 mJy, which is much below the measured value of 31 mJy.

The free-free contribution (“bremsstrahlung”) can be computed from the H $\alpha$ flux. The Balmer lines provide an estimate of the number of ionizing photons present in the source. If the optical extinction is known, the H $\alpha$ flux can be used to compute the thermal radio continuum flux (e.g., Caplan & Deharveng 1986). Assuming an electron temperature of $10^{4}$ K and an optical extinction of $A_{V}=4$ (Eckart et al. 1991), the thermal radio continuum flux density at 3.5 cm is 14.8 mJy, obtained by integrating the H $\alpha$ luminosity in the outflow. The H $\alpha$ extinction is given by $A_{H\alpha}=0.605*A_{V}$ . Figure 6 shows the ratio between the radio flux density (mJy) and the H $\alpha$ luminosity (in units of $10^{40}$ erg/s) for the thermal (free–free) contribution versus wavelength. This ratio is 75% at 3.5 cm. The maximum thermal contribution to the flux density at 3.5 cm is thus about 23 mJy (Zurita et al. 2000) which is consistent with our previous estimation of 6 mJy for the non-thermal radiocontinuum.

Table 4 gives an estimate of the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the observed radio continuum emission, using the H $\alpha$ luminosities to estimate the thermal component. At 20 cm the radio continuum emission is mainly non-thermal (87 %), but at shorter wavelengths (6 and 3.5 cm) both contributions are comparable.

4 Molecular gas

 However, according to the analysis of the spectral index distribution, the flat-spectrum (non-thermal) emission appears to dominate, as the majority of the regions exhibit a spectral index α < 0.5, which is characteristic of synchrotron radiation. The spatial distribution of the emission suggests that the flat-spectrum regions are associated with highly structured areas, possibly linked to star-forming regions or supernova remnants, where magnetic fields and high-energy particles are prevalent. This interpretation aligns with the idea that non-thermal emission is a key component in the energy output of such galaxies, contributing significantly to their overall luminosity and spectral energy distribution.

Apart from the central concentration, the CO emission is extended along the bar towards the western side (“W”) and has a smaller extension to the eastern side. Assuming that the external spiral arms are trailing, this CO emission is on the leading side of the bar.

The western CO feature, which extends to 10″ from the center, is aligned with the primary bar. The CO emission is associated with two H $\alpha$ -emitting star forming regions (with $5\times 10^{39}$ and $3\times 10^{39}$ erg.s \textsuperscript{-1} H $\alpha$ luminosities not corrected for extinction) which are among the brightest in NGC 6764, excluding the strong H $\alpha$ emission at the tip of the bar (Rozas et al. 1996). Since NGC 6764 is highly inclined, the location of star formation and molecular gas in these regions is not completely clear.

Figure 7 shows the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) channel maps at 10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} velocity resolution relative to systemic. \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission is detected in the individual channels at 2.5 $\sigma$ level from 2210 to 2600 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (LSR). Two \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) peaks are seen in the very center at negative and positive velocities. The first of these strong peaks is seen mainly at negative velocities ( $-110$ to $-20$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} ), and is separated from the primary CO peak by $\sim$ 2″. This secondary peak is not visible in the integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) map. Extended weaker features are visible in the channel maps as well. One feature is seen north of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) peak at velocities $-40$ to 130 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Another more extended feature (see Figure 8 ) is seen at velocities 20 to 100 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . The first feature is associated with the molecular outflow, visible in the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) integrated intensity image, and flaring up to a 8″( $\sim$ 1 kpc) height. Correcting for the disk inclination, the molecular gas reaches 1.5 kpc above the plane of the galaxy. The velocities are consistent with motion perpendicular to the galaxy plane, taking into account the inclination and orientation of NGC 6764.

The faint extended feature between 20 and 100 km s \textsuperscript{-1} covers an area of about 1 kpc \textsuperscript{2} between 5″and 10″ radii (800 – 1600 pc). At a velocity of 70 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , it reaches a total length of 12″ ( $\sim$ 1.9 kpc), and is oriented north to south. The velocity field shows few signs of outflow motion in this region, indicating that this feature is in the plane of the galaxy. The western feature (W) has a large velocity extent from $-80$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} up to 10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . A CO spur is visible towards the north, and its location is spatially correlated with the boundary of the radio continuum superbubble, as seen at 20 cm.

Figure 9 shows the beam-smeared map of the intensity-weighted \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) velocity field, derived from the first moment of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data cube, overlaid on the 20 cm radio continuum emission. We determined the dynamical center of the gas motion from the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data, and compared it to the positions of the various emission peaks (see Table 5 ). HS06 find an offset of 0.55″between the VLA A-array peak at 3.5 cm and the optical nucleus. They explain that difference by a higher extinction close to the nucleus, which is consistent with the molecular gas distribution. The dynamical center of CO emission is spatially coincident with the nucleus as seen in the $B$ - and $I$ -bands, and located about 0 $\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}$ 5 ( $\sim 80$ parsecs) from the radio continuum peak. Our observations are consistent with the global rotation of the galaxy disk, combined with streaming motions along the bar and/or a warping of the disk. The strongest deviation from the rotation pattern, the so-called “spider diagram,” is seen on the eastern side along the molecular outflow, which originates from the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) peak, at 1″–2″ to the NE of the radio continuum peak. The noise in the velocity field there is significant since the CO emission is centrally concentrated and the emission intensity is much lower beyond the peak. The position angle (P.A.) of the galaxy major axis, determined from the velocity field, 70 \textsuperscript{∘} $\pm 5$ , is slightly larger than the P.A. from the orientation of the optical isophotes (61 $\aas@@fstack{\circ}$ 5). The HI data of Wilcots et al. (2001) indicate a change in the P.A. between the outer part ( $\sim 58\mbox{${}^{\circ}$}$ ) and the inner part of the disk ( $\sim 76\mbox{${}^{\circ}$}$ ). The difference is most likely due to the streaming motion near the center caused by the bar, as confirmed by the disturbed CO velocity field.

Figure 10 shows the beam-smeared map of the intensity-weighted \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) velocity dispersion in the center, derived from the second moment of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) data cube, overlaid with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) velocity field. The central velocity dispersion $\sigma_{V}$ = 200 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , is much higher than the internal velocity dispersion of a molecular cloud (typically a few km s \textsuperscript{-1} ; see e.g. Scoville et al. 1987). More likely, it results from the beam-smeared velocity gradient caused by a steeply rising rotation curve, together with a contribution from streaming motions.

Within the astrometric accuracy the peak of the velocity dispersion is located at the position of the dynamical center. At the position of the molecular outflow the velocity dispersion has values up to 150 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , whereas along the bar, at radii larger than 5″ from the nucleus, the molecular gas velocity dispersion does not exceed 50 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Curiously, the velocity dispersion is asymmetric in the east–west direction, with larger values on the eastern side.

The observed morphology of the SiO/H \textsuperscript{13}CO \textsuperscript{+} maps and their comparison with other molecular gas tracers can be attributed to gas accumulation at the inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs) of the bar in NGC 253. Arnaboldi et al. (1995) independently determined the locations of these bar resonances using H $\alpha$ major-axis kinematics. Through the epicyclic approximation, they identified two ILRs within the galaxy's nucleus. Assuming a lower limit for the bar corotation radius, R \textsubscript{cor} = 3.9 kpc, they calculated an outer ILR (oILR) at 300 pc (20 $\arcsec$) and an inner ILR (iILR) near the center, findings consistent with the current study. Investigating the gas kinematics in the SiO/H \textsuperscript{13}CO \textsuperscript{+} circumnuclear disk (CND) will enable testing of the principal resonance locations and elucidate the connection between the starburst activity and the bar structure.

Figure 12 shows the position–velocity (PV) diagrams of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) emission along the major and minor axes (P.A. = 62 \textsuperscript{∘} and P.A. = 152 \textsuperscript{∘} ) of NGC 6764, along with a PV diagram at P.A. = 90 \textsuperscript{∘} for comparison with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) observations made with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (Eckart et al. 1996). As already shown by Eckart et al. (1996), the PV diagrams imply an asymmetric distribution of molecular gas near the nucleus. The CO intensity is higher for gas at redshifted velocities, with respect to the systemic velocity, i.e., on the eastern side. The PV diagram at P.A. = 90 \textsuperscript{∘} in the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission shows strong streaming motion at x= $-4$ ″, which is located slightly inside the iILR ( $r\sim 6\arcsec$ ). The \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) PV diagram along the minor axis reveals large streaming motions at x = 1″–2″, with a velocity near $-200$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Similarly, the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) PV diagram along the minor axis shows an area of lower density gas on the eastern side at radii $<5\arcsec$ , with streaming motions at negative velocities. The spur visible between x-positions 1″ and 6″ in the velocity range [-30,80] km s \textsuperscript{-1} (relative to 2400 km s \textsuperscript{-1} ) is located in the molecular outflow, and is consistent with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) spectrum integrated over the outflow area. Assuming a trailing spiral structure, the northern part of NGC 6764 is closer to us, which implies largely redshifted (positive) velocities for the radial outflow in the northern side, as is seen in the PV diagram and in the integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) spectrum.

The ratio of N(SiO) to N($^{13}$CO$^+$) allows us to determine the absolute abundance of SiO ($X($SiO$) = N($SiO$) / N($H_2$)) by assuming a standard value for $^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance ($\langle X(^{13}$CO$^+)$ $\rangle$). SiO is anticipated to be more responsive than $^{13}$CO$^+$ to changes in the chemical environment of NGC 253. This assumption aligns with abundance measurements of $^{12}$CO$^+$ in diverse Galactic molecular clouds, where values near $10^{-8}$ are consistently observed, leading to $\langle X(^{13}$CO$^+)$ $\rangle \sim 10^{-10}$ when using a $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C ratio of approximately 1/90. While $X(^{12}$CO$^+)$ may decrease to $10^{-10}$ in the hot cores of giant molecular clouds, SiO abundance is similarly reduced in these regions (Blake et al. 1987). Furthermore, compact sources are not expected to dominate the $^{13}$CO$^+$ (1–0) emission at the scales observed in NGC 253’s nucleus. Unlike $X(^{13}$CO$^+)$, $X($SiO$)$ varies significantly across the Galaxy, depending on the molecular cloud type and location (see discussion). For the nucleus of NGC 253, we estimate $\langle N(^{13}$CO$^+)$ $\rangle = 3 \times 10^{12}$, averaged over the circumnuclear disk (CND). Similarly, $\langle N($H_2$) $\rangle$ is derived from the $^{12}$CO(1–0) map of Canzian et al. (1988), yielding $\langle N($H_2$) $\rangle \sim 3 \times 10^{22}$ using a conversion factor of $x = N($H_2$) / I_{CO} = 3 \times 10^{20}$ cm$^2$ K km$^{-1}$ s. This results in $\langle X(^{13}$CO$^+)$ $\rangle \sim 10^{-10}$ in NGC 253, comparable to Galactic values.

The structural characteristics of the CND were analyzed through the examination of peak brightness flux distributions in the respective spectral lines, defined as \( B^{\text{peak}}(x,y) = \max[T_{\text{mb}}]_v(x,y) \). This approach isolates the highest spatial frequencies, thereby emphasizing the most prominent features in the data. Subsequently, the \( B^{\text{peak}} \) values were projected onto the galactic plane to create a face-on representation of the CND, as illustrated in Figures 4a and 4b. Observations reveal that the emission peaks of ring I are predominantly aligned with the disk's major axis, which is inclined 20° clockwise relative to the bar's major axis. This angular deviation is more evident in the H\( ^{13} \)CO\( ^+ \) data, as seen in Figure 4a. Conversely, the emission peaks of ring II exhibit a more expansive distribution, crossing the bar's major axis and forming a spiral-like arc. The face-on depiction in Figure 4a highlights a gaseous spiral-like ridge (ring II) that terminates in an unresolved, edge-on ring I, which remains aligned with the disk's major axis.

In the preceding section, we demonstrated that the majority of the SiO/H \textsuperscript{13}CO \textsuperscript{+} emission in the CND aligns with the bar-driven gas flow scenario. However, we identified an unusual component in Section 3 that may lie outside the CND plane. This off-axis gas, predominantly observed in the SiO line (T \textsubscript{mb} (SiO)/T \textsubscript{mb} (H \textsuperscript{13}CO \textsuperscript{+} = 3-5), is most prominent in the southern direction (below the CND plane). The southern SiO plume originates at the base of the starburst ring I and extends to a height of $\delta$ y = 10 $\arcsec$ (measured from the bar's major axis; see Figure 4b). The gas exhibits significant deviations from circular motion ($\Delta_{v} \sim$ 100-150 km s \textsuperscript{-1}) and spans a velocity range of $\sim$ 200 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (see Figure 6b). A weaker, point-like counterpart of the southern SiO plume is observed in the north, where the gas also shows strong non-circular motions ($\Delta_{v} \sim$ -150 km s \textsuperscript{-1}) but is characterized by a narrow profile ($\sim$ 17 km s \textsuperscript{-1}). SiO spectra for these regions are shown in Figure 7. The Northern and Southern plumes (referred to as N and S) are aligned along a line passing through the dynamical center, with a position angle (PA) of 131 \textsuperscript{∘} measured from North (see Figure 4b). This orientation situates the anomalous component near the galaxy's minor axis (PA = 141 \textsuperscript{∘}), where no contribution from the rotation curve in the radial velocity gradient is anticipated. Additionally, the large non-circular motions ($\Delta_{v} \sim$ 100-150 km s \textsuperscript{-1}) are difficult to explain solely through bar-driven dynamics in the galaxy plane.

While the majority of the emission originates from the double-ringed structure (I-II), additional gas has been observed outside the x-axis, particularly within the CND structure along the minor axis, which is partially resolved. While some of this emission can be attributed to the projected gas distribution of the CND disk (as NGC 253 is not fully edge-on), significant portions lie far from the NIR bar major axis, notably in regions where gas clouds exhibit highly non-circular motions and an elevated relative abundance of SiO (T mb(SiO)/T mb(H¹³CO⁺) = 3–5). Specifically, the SiO emission channels in Figure 2 within the velocity range [284–335 km s⁻¹] reveal receding gas (v – vsys = 80 km s⁻¹; vsys = 235 km s⁻¹) in the SE quadrant, where it is expected to be approaching. This anomalous component is linked to the giant outflow observed in X-ray and optical emission lines and is distinct from the I-II structures. However, a H¹³CO⁺ clump located at (x,y) ≈ (1,8) lacks a corresponding SiO counterpart, suggesting it may represent disk gas seen in projection. This clump exhibits a low T mb(SiO)/T mb(H¹³CO⁺) ratio (~0.3) and lies near the minor axis, with velocities close to vsys.

Adopting a standard conversion factor of X ${}_{\mbox{CO}}=2.3\times 10^{20}\leavevmode\nobreak\$ cm \textsuperscript{-2} (K km s \textsuperscript{-1} ) \textsuperscript{-1} (e.g., Strong et al. 1988), the total mass of molecular hydrogen ( H \textsubscript{2} ) is:

where $S_{CO}$ is the integrated CO flux density in Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} and $D$ is the distance in Mpc. The integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) flux density from our new map gives a total molecular hydrogen mass of $1.0\times 10^{9}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ . It does not take into account the 50 % of flux filtered out by the interferometer observations.

In the Milky Way’s disk the X ${}_{\mbox{CO}}$ conversion factor derived from observations has been found to match the theoretical conversion factor quite well (e.g., Radford et al. 1991). However, there is growing evidence that the conversion factor is overestimated by a factor of 3–10 in the central part of galaxies, especially in those with nuclear starbursts (Downes & Solomon 1998). The physical reasons for this discrepancy have been discussed in several papers, and include the metallicity gradient (e.g., Dahmen et al. 1998), broadening of the CO line by the bulge potential (e.g., Stacy et al. 1989, Mauersberger et al. 1996), and changes in the physical conditions of the circumnuclear gas (e.g., its optical depth, temperature, and density). In NGC 253, a nearby starburst galaxy, Mauersberger et al. (1996) found a conversion factor $\sim 7$ times lower than $X^{std}_{CO}$ in the central part of the galaxy. They argued that the central potential well is broadening the CO lines, and its emission could be partially optically thin. The conversion factor has been found to be 3 to 10 times lower in the galactic bulges compared to their disks (Sodroski et al. 1995). Recently, Weiß et al. (2001) analyzed the variations of X ${}_{\mbox{CO}}$ in the starburst of M82 in detail. They found that “ X ${}_{\mbox{CO}}$ is a function of the intrinsic gas properties, which strongly depend on environmental effects” (massive star formation). This leads to a variation of X by a factor of 5–10, compared to the Galactic value of X ${}_{\mbox{CO}}=1.6\times 10^{20}$ cm \textsuperscript{-2} K km s \textsuperscript{-1} .

The dust mass computed from the IRAS fluxes at 60 and 100 $\mu$ m gives a total mass of M \textsubscript{d} = $1.4\times 10^{6}\mbox{$\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$}$ with a mean temperature of 36.5 K. It is known from FIR observations with ISO that the IRAS data are missing a cold dust component that emits beyond 150 $\mu$ m and has a temperature of T ${}_{d}<20$ K, (Alton et al. 1998, Trewhella et al. 2000). This component can be 2–10 times more massive than the warm dust component.

Alton et al. (1999) have recently reported the preliminary identification of submillimeter emission at 450 $\mu$m originating from a filament linked to the S outflow. The spatial correspondence of the S filament aligns well with the previously observed structure in SiO/H \textsuperscript{13}CO\textsuperscript{+} (see above and Figure 4b). However, estimating the dust mass within the filaments remains challenging due to its dependence on dust temperature and the limited data from a single wavelength detection. As anticipated from the flux measured at 450 $\mu$m, no counterparts of the dust outflow are evident at 1mm or 3mm bands (see section 3.1; also Krügel et al., 1990). 

To address this, we attempt to derive the dust column density toward the S filament using the flux reported by Alton et al. (1999), adjusted for our beam parameters. A dust emissivity spectral index of $\beta$ = 2 is assumed, following the emissivity model from Chini et al. (1997), with a dust temperature range of T \textsubscript{dust} = 13K-37K, consistent with the M82 dust outflow model (Alton et al., 1999). This calculation yields a column density of N ${}_{dust}\sim$ 0.6–4 $\times$ 10\textsuperscript{4} M \textsubscript{⊙} within the beam. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of M \textsubscript{gas}/M \textsubscript{dust} = 100, the inferred molecular hydrogen density is N(H \textsubscript{2}) $\sim$ 0.6–4 $\times$ 10\textsuperscript{6} M \textsubscript{⊙}/beam. 

In section 7, we further estimate N(H \textsubscript{2}) in the S filament where H \textsuperscript{13}CO\textsuperscript{+} is detected, utilizing the column density derived from a Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) transfer model and an abundance ratio X(H \textsuperscript{13}CO\textsuperscript{+}) = 10\textsuperscript{-10}. This yields N(H \textsubscript{2}) $\sim$ 3.5 $\times$ 10\textsuperscript{6} M \textsubscript{⊙}/beam (4.7 $\times$ 10\textsuperscript{22} cm\textsuperscript{-2}), which aligns closely with the dust-based estimate. Consequently, the absence of a continuum detection for the S outflow does not conflict with the successful detection of the outflow in the SiO and H \textsuperscript{13}CO\textsuperscript{+} lines.

Observations using interferometers by Canzian et al. (1988) revealed that the majority of molecular gas in the Circumnuclear Disk (CND), as traced by the 1–0 line of \textsuperscript{12}CO, is arranged in a bar-like structure aligned with the near-infrared (NIR) bar. This finding is corroborated by the \textsuperscript{13}CO map produced by Hüttemeister and Aalto (1998). In contrast, the distribution of dense gas (n(H\textsubscript{2}) > 10\textsuperscript{5–6} cm\textsuperscript{–3}) resembles the B-peak maps of SiO and H\textsuperscript{13}CO\textsuperscript{+}. The CN(1–0) and HNC(1–0) maps from Hüttemeister and Aalto (1998) depict a compact inner disk, approximately 8$\arcsec$ in diameter, oriented along a position angle (PA) of 45–50 degrees. The outer disk, however, tilts more steeply toward PA=70 degrees, forming a spiral-like arc crossing the major axis of the stellar bar. Similarly, the HCN(1–0) map by Paglione et al. (1995) shows an inner disk aligned with the disk's major axis (PA=45 degrees), while the outer ring progressively tilts toward PA=70 degrees.

4.1 Distribution

The CO emission detected with the PdBI is strongly concentrated toward the center of NGC 6764 (see Figure 2 ) and reaches a maximum at a projected distance of 1 $\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}$ 25 ( $\sim$ 190 pc) from the radio continuum peak. More than 98% of the total molecular gas is concentrated within the inner 800 pc, and as much as 20% of the total \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission is included within one beam.

Apart from the central concentration, the CO emission is extended along the bar towards the western side (“W”) and has a smaller extension to the eastern side. Assuming that the external spiral arms are trailing, this CO emission is on the leading side of the bar.

The western CO feature, which extends to 10″ from the center, is aligned with the primary bar. The CO emission is associated with two H $\alpha$ -emitting star forming regions (with $5\times 10^{39}$ and $3\times 10^{39}$ erg.s \textsuperscript{-1} H $\alpha$ luminosities not corrected for extinction) which are among the brightest in NGC 6764, excluding the strong H $\alpha$ emission at the tip of the bar (Rozas et al. 1996). Since NGC 6764 is highly inclined, the location of star formation and molecular gas in these regions is not completely clear.

Figure 7 shows the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) channel maps at 10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} velocity resolution relative to systemic. \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission is detected in the individual channels at 2.5 $\sigma$ level from 2210 to 2600 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (LSR). Two \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) peaks are seen in the very center at negative and positive velocities. The first of these strong peaks is seen mainly at negative velocities ( $-110$ to $-20$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} ), and is separated from the primary CO peak by $\sim$ 2″. This secondary peak is not visible in the integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) map. Extended weaker features are visible in the channel maps as well. One feature is seen north of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) peak at velocities $-40$ to 130 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Another more extended feature (see Figure 8 ) is seen at velocities 20 to 100 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . The first feature is associated with the molecular outflow, visible in the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) integrated intensity image, and flaring up to a 8″( $\sim$ 1 kpc) height. Correcting for the disk inclination, the molecular gas reaches 1.5 kpc above the plane of the galaxy. The velocities are consistent with motion perpendicular to the galaxy plane, taking into account the inclination and orientation of NGC 6764.

The faint extended feature between 20 and 100 km s \textsuperscript{-1} covers an area of about 1 kpc \textsuperscript{2} between 5″and 10″ radii (800 – 1600 pc). At a velocity of 70 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , it reaches a total length of 12″ ( $\sim$ 1.9 kpc), and is oriented north to south. The velocity field shows few signs of outflow motion in this region, indicating that this feature is in the plane of the galaxy. The western feature (W) has a large velocity extent from $-80$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} up to 10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . A CO spur is visible towards the north, and its location is spatially correlated with the boundary of the radio continuum superbubble, as seen at 20 cm.

4.2 Kinematics

Figure 9 shows the beam-smeared map of the intensity-weighted \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) velocity field, derived from the first moment of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data cube, overlaid on the 20 cm radio continuum emission. We determined the dynamical center of the gas motion from the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data, and compared it to the positions of the various emission peaks (see Table 5 ). HS06 find an offset of 0.55″between the VLA A-array peak at 3.5 cm and the optical nucleus. They explain that difference by a higher extinction close to the nucleus, which is consistent with the molecular gas distribution. The dynamical center of CO emission is spatially coincident with the nucleus as seen in the $B$ - and $I$ -bands, and located about 0 $\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}$ 5 ( $\sim 80$ parsecs) from the radio continuum peak. Our observations are consistent with the global rotation of the galaxy disk, combined with streaming motions along the bar and/or a warping of the disk. The strongest deviation from the rotation pattern, the so-called “spider diagram,” is seen on the eastern side along the molecular outflow, which originates from the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) peak, at 1″–2″ to the NE of the radio continuum peak. The noise in the velocity field there is significant since the CO emission is centrally concentrated and the emission intensity is much lower beyond the peak. The position angle (P.A.) of the galaxy major axis, determined from the velocity field, 70 \textsuperscript{∘} $\pm 5$ , is slightly larger than the P.A. from the orientation of the optical isophotes (61 $\aas@@fstack{\circ}$ 5). The HI data of Wilcots et al. (2001) indicate a change in the P.A. between the outer part ( $\sim 58\mbox{${}^{\circ}$}$ ) and the inner part of the disk ( $\sim 76\mbox{${}^{\circ}$}$ ). The difference is most likely due to the streaming motion near the center caused by the bar, as confirmed by the disturbed CO velocity field.

Figure 10 shows the beam-smeared map of the intensity-weighted \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) velocity dispersion in the center, derived from the second moment of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) data cube, overlaid with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) velocity field. The central velocity dispersion $\sigma_{V}$ = 200 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , is much higher than the internal velocity dispersion of a molecular cloud (typically a few km s \textsuperscript{-1} ; see e.g. Scoville et al. 1987). More likely, it results from the beam-smeared velocity gradient caused by a steeply rising rotation curve, together with a contribution from streaming motions.

Within the astrometric accuracy the peak of the velocity dispersion is located at the position of the dynamical center. At the position of the molecular outflow the velocity dispersion has values up to 150 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , whereas along the bar, at radii larger than 5″ from the nucleus, the molecular gas velocity dispersion does not exceed 50 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Curiously, the velocity dispersion is asymmetric in the east–west direction, with larger values on the eastern side.

The rotation curve has been computed from our \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) data and the HI data from Wilcots et al. (2001), using the task INSPECTOR in Gipsy . Although the HI spatial resolution is poorer than in CO, it provides data points at large radii. The rotation curve becomes flat at a value of 250 km s \textsuperscript{-1} at $\sim$ 12 kpc from the center. Under the assumption of the epicyclic approximation, the azimuthal frequency ( $\Omega$ ) and the radial frequency ( $\kappa$ ) have been computed from the rotation curve. The bar pattern speed is estimated from the rotation curve and the length of the bar semi-major axis ( $\sim$ 6.5 kpc). Several studies (e.g., Athanassoula 1992, Combes & Elmegreen 1993, Sempere et al. 1995) have shown that the ratio of the bar corotation radius to the bar semi-major axis length is in the range 1–1.5. The determination of the bar pattern speed is not strongly dependent on the exact value of this ratio since the frequency $\Omega$ is flat in that domain. The bar pattern speed $\Omega_{bar}$ is $\sim$ 22 km s \textsuperscript{-1} kpc \textsuperscript{-1} with a corotation (CR) at a radius of 40″ (6.5 kpc), using a value of 1 for the ratio of the radius of the CR to the length of the bar semi-major axis. The inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), if they exist, are the loci where the bar pattern speed equals $\Omega-\kappa/2$ (Figure 11 ). Thus, the epicyclic approximation suggests that two ILRs are present near the center. The rough radii for the inner and outer ILRs (iILR and oILR) are 6″ and 10″ (1 and 1.7 kpc). 4:1 resonances, or (inner/outer) ultraharmonic resonances (i/oUHR), with $\Omega_{bar}=\Omega\pm\kappa/4$ , are found at radii of 24″ (3.9 kpc; iUHR) and 100″ (16.5 kpc; oUHR). At these resonances the star orbits are periodic and form rings (e.g, Byrd et al. 1998). Contrary to the UHR location, the locations of the ILRs strongly depend on the bar pattern speed. Table 6 summarizes the locations of the resonances found with the application of the epicyclic approximation, valid for asymptotically weak bars. In the presence of an even moderately strong bar, an accurate determination of the resonance positions requires a full dynamical model, together with orbit analysis, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

Figure 12 shows the position–velocity (PV) diagrams of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) emission along the major and minor axes (P.A. = 62 \textsuperscript{∘} and P.A. = 152 \textsuperscript{∘} ) of NGC 6764, along with a PV diagram at P.A. = 90 \textsuperscript{∘} for comparison with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) observations made with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (Eckart et al. 1996). As already shown by Eckart et al. (1996), the PV diagrams imply an asymmetric distribution of molecular gas near the nucleus. The CO intensity is higher for gas at redshifted velocities, with respect to the systemic velocity, i.e., on the eastern side. The PV diagram at P.A. = 90 \textsuperscript{∘} in the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission shows strong streaming motion at x= $-4$ ″, which is located slightly inside the iILR ( $r\sim 6\arcsec$ ). The \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) PV diagram along the minor axis reveals large streaming motions at x = 1″–2″, with a velocity near $-200$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Similarly, the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) PV diagram along the minor axis shows an area of lower density gas on the eastern side at radii $<5\arcsec$ , with streaming motions at negative velocities. The spur visible between x-positions 1″ and 6″ in the velocity range [-30,80] km s \textsuperscript{-1} (relative to 2400 km s \textsuperscript{-1} ) is located in the molecular outflow, and is consistent with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) spectrum integrated over the outflow area. Assuming a trailing spiral structure, the northern part of NGC 6764 is closer to us, which implies largely redshifted (positive) velocities for the radial outflow in the northern side, as is seen in the PV diagram and in the integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) spectrum.

4.2.1 First and second velocity moments

Figure 9 shows the beam-smeared map of the intensity-weighted \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) velocity field, derived from the first moment of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data cube, overlaid on the 20 cm radio continuum emission. We determined the dynamical center of the gas motion from the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data, and compared it to the positions of the various emission peaks (see Table 5 ). HS06 find an offset of 0.55″between the VLA A-array peak at 3.5 cm and the optical nucleus. They explain that difference by a higher extinction close to the nucleus, which is consistent with the molecular gas distribution.

The noise in the velocity field there is significant since the CO emission is centrally concentrated and the emission intensity is much lower beyond the peak. The position angle (P.A.) of the galaxy major axis, determined from the velocity field, 70 \textsuperscript{∘} $\pm 5$ , is slightly larger than the P.A. from the orientation of the optical isophotes (61 $\aas@@fstack{\circ}$ 5). The HI data of Wilcots et al. (2001) indicate a change in the P.A. between the outer part ( $\sim 58\mbox{${}^{\circ}$}$ ) and the inner part of the disk ( $\sim 76\mbox{${}^{\circ}$}$ ). The difference is most likely due to the streaming motion near the center caused by the bar, as confirmed by the disturbed CO velocity field.

Figure 10 shows the beam-smeared map of the intensity-weighted \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) velocity dispersion in the center, derived from the second moment of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) data cube, overlaid with the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) velocity field. The central velocity dispersion $\sigma_{V}$ = 200 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , is much higher than the internal velocity dispersion of a molecular cloud (typically a few km s \textsuperscript{-1} ; see e.g. Scoville et al. 1987).

At the position of the molecular outflow the velocity dispersion has values up to 150 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , whereas along the bar, at radii larger than 5″ from the nucleus, the molecular gas velocity dispersion does not exceed 50 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Curiously, the velocity dispersion is asymmetric in the east–west direction, with larger values on the eastern side.

4.2.2 Lindblad resonances

The rotation curve has been computed from our \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) data and the HI data from Wilcots et al. (2001), using the task INSPECTOR in Gipsy . Although the HI spatial resolution is poorer than in CO, it provides data points at large radii. The rotation curve becomes flat at a value of 250 km s \textsuperscript{-1} at $\sim$ 12 kpc from the center. Under the assumption of the epicyclic approximation, the azimuthal frequency ( $\Omega$ ) and the radial frequency ( $\kappa$ ) have been computed from the rotation curve. The bar pattern speed is estimated from the rotation curve and the length of the bar semi-major axis ( $\sim$ 6.5 kpc). Several studies (e.g., Athanassoula 1992, Combes & Elmegreen 1993, Sempere et al. 1995) have shown that the ratio of the bar corotation radius to the bar semi-major axis length is in the range 1–1.5. The determination of the bar pattern speed is not strongly dependent on the exact value of this ratio since the frequency $\Omega$ is flat in that domain. The bar pattern speed $\Omega_{bar}$ is $\sim$ 22 km s \textsuperscript{-1} kpc \textsuperscript{-1} with a corotation (CR) at a radius of 40″ (6.5 kpc), using a value of 1 for the ratio of the radius of the CR to the length of the bar semi-major axis. The inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), if they exist, are the loci where the bar pattern speed equals $\Omega-\kappa/2$ (Figure 11 ). Thus, the epicyclic approximation suggests that two ILRs are present near the center. The rough radii for the inner and outer ILRs (iILR and oILR) are 6″ and 10″ (1 and 1.7 kpc). 4:1 resonances, or (inner/outer) ultraharmonic resonances (i/oUHR), with $\Omega_{bar}=\Omega\pm\kappa/4$ , are found at radii of 24″ (3.9 kpc; iUHR) and 100″ (16.5 kpc; oUHR). At these resonances the star orbits are periodic and form rings (e.g, Byrd et al. 1998). Contrary to the UHR location, the locations of the ILRs strongly depend on the bar pattern speed. Table 6 summarizes the locations of the resonances found with the application of the epicyclic approximation, valid for asymptotically weak bars. In the presence of an even moderately strong bar, an accurate determination of the resonance positions requires a full dynamical model, together with orbit analysis, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

4.2.3 Non-circular motions

 There are two distinct components within the galaxy's structure: a more compact inner disk and a more extended outer disk. The inner disk is characterized by a higher surface brightness and a shorter scale length compared to the outer disk. The transition between these two components occurs at a radius of approximately R = 20 kpc. The presence of a stellar bar in NGC 253 is well-established, oriented along a position angle of PA = 68°, with an extent of about 300 arcseconds on the sky. This places a lower limit on the bar's corotation radius at R_COR = 150 arcseconds, as determined by Scoville et al. (1985). P96 originally interpreted the distribution of CS(2–1) emission as a result of the bar's gravitational influence. However, their model arbitrarily set the bar's corotation radius at 40 arcseconds, which is approximately four times shorter than the estimated semi-major axis of the bar (~150 arcseconds). Observational challenges arise due to dust extinction distorting the near-infrared (NIR) image of the bar. Two dust lane ridges are observed offset from the bar's major axis. Based on the assumption that the northwest side of NGC 253 is the near side (De Vaucouleurs 1958), these offset dust lanes within the bar likely represent a trailing spiral wave. This feature suggests the presence of two inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), designated as the outer oILR and inner iILR (Athanassoula 1992). The response of gas to a bar potential in the vicinity of these ILRs has been extensively studied by multiple researchers (Buta and Combes 1996 and references therein). Due to dissipative processes like cloud-cloud collisions, the gas does not follow the same periodic orbits as stars (e.g., x1 orbits parallel between corotation and oILR, or x2 orbits antiparallel between oILR and iILR). Instead, the gas response leads the stellar orbits, creating a trailing spiral pattern inside the bar's corotation that extends across the oILR. This pattern is tentatively identified with the spiral-like feature labeled II, which may correspond to the oILR. The compression of gas along the spiral ridges is most effectively traced by high-density molecular gas tracers. In contrast, the nuclear spiral crossing the oILR appears less prominent in maps of lower or moderate-density molecular gas (n(H2) ≈ 10^3-10^4 cm^-3), as seen in 13CO and 12CO observations.

4.3 CO line ratio

The line ratio for the integrated CO intensity between the \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) transitions, $\Re=I(\mbox{${}^{12}$CO(2--1) })/I(\mbox{${}^{12}$CO(1--0) })$ , was computed matching the u-v coverage of both transitions and using the same spatial resolution and taking only the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) data above a threshold of $3\sigma$ . The result is shown in Figure 13 . The maximum $\Re$ is 0.98, in agreement with that estimated by Eckart et al. (1991) from single dish observations. Eckart et al. (1991) interpreted the global ratio to arise from moderately warm, dense, and optically thick gas.

We have estimated the zero-spacing flux missing from our maps. Given that the interferometer measures the shortest spacing of approximately 20 meters, we expect to filter out scales of roughly 30 arcseconds. In comparison to the 30-meter data from MP99, only about 20% of the single-dish flux in both SiO and H¹³CO⁺ is missing within the primary beam. Consequently, our dataset provides an unbiased representation of the total SiO and H¹³CO⁺ gas content in the nucleus of NGC 253.

The \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) / \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) line ratio has been computed for each channel (10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} width). Figure 15 shows the CO line ratio from a channel at $-180$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} up to a channel at 200 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (the systemic velocity of NGC 6764 is 2400 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , corresponding to a zero velocity in the channel maps). From $-180$ to $-40$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} the peak of the CO line ratio is spatially coincident with the nucleus (or the radio continuum peak, as indicated by a cross in the figure). The peak at $-140$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} seen in Figure 14 is likely to be an edge effect. The “true” maximum is reached at $-130$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} , where the ratio reaches a value of 1.4 at the exact position of the radio continuum peak (to within a pixel width). The western CO emission feature has a mean CO line ratio of 0.3, which is likely to be an underestimate because of the filtering out of the extended emission.

The high CO line ratios for the blueshifted gas in the nucleus may be associated with outflowing molecular gas powered by the AGN or the starburst. HS06 reported a possible blueshifted HI absorption at $\sim 120\mbox{km\leavevmode\nobreak\ s${}^{-1}$}$ against the compact core which may be related to the molecular gas with such high CO line ratios. We note that the radio continuum map (Fig. 1 ) has hints of a nuclear radio jet towards the south, likely associated with blue-shifted motions there as expected if the orientation of NGC 6764 with respect to the line of sight is taken into account. A redshifted counterpart with such a high line ratio is not detected.

4.4 H \textsubscript{2} mass

Adopting a standard conversion factor of X ${}_{\mbox{CO}}=2.3\times 10^{20}\leavevmode\nobreak\$ cm \textsuperscript{-2} (K km s \textsuperscript{-1} ) \textsuperscript{-1} (e.g., Strong et al. 1988), the total mass of molecular hydrogen ( H \textsubscript{2} ) is:


 
 $M_{H_{2}}=9\leavevmode\nobreak\ \times\leavevmode\nobreak\ 10^{3}\leavevmode\nobreak\ S_{CO}\leavevmode\nobreak\ D^{2}$  (2) 


where $S_{CO}$ is the integrated CO flux density in Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} and $D$ is the distance in Mpc. The integrated \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) flux density from our new map gives a total molecular hydrogen mass of $1.0\times 10^{9}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ . It does not take into account the 50 % of flux filtered out by the interferometer observations.

The inner ring (I), characterized by an average diameter of \( D_I \sim 8 \arcsec \) (120 pc), accounts for approximately 60-70% of the total flux observed in the two emission lines. This region coincides with the massive starburst activity in NGC 253, as previously identified through various observational tracers. The outer ring (II), with an average diameter of \( D_{II} \sim 24 \arcsec \) (360 pc), contributes 20-30% of the total flux. Both rings share the same central point, which corresponds to the peak of the 3mm continuum emission. The emission from ring I spans a large velocity range (\( \sim 120 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \)) across its two edges, and this velocity spread is symmetrically distributed around the continuum source. A similar symmetry is observed in ring II. This symmetry suggests that the continuum peak is the dynamical center of NGC 253, located at \( \alpha_{J2000} = 00^h47^m33.18^s \) and \( \delta_{J2000} = -25^\circ17'17.2'' \). This position aligns, within observational uncertainties, with the dynamical center previously determined using optical (Watson et al. 1996), infrared (Sams et al. 1994; Boker et al. 1998), and radio (Turner & Ho 1985) data.

The LVG modeling relies on three key parameters: the hydrogen density \( n(\text{H}_2) \), the kinetic temperature \( T_K \), and the abundance of the species. The kinetic temperature of the molecular gas near the center of NGC 253 has been extensively studied using multi-transition observations of \(^{12}\text{CO}\) and its isotopic variants (\(^{13}\text{CO}\) and \(^{18}\text{O}\)), as well as CS and HCN. These studies consistently yield an average \( T_K > 50 \, \text{K} \). For this analysis, we adopt \( T_K = 50 \, \text{K} \) as representative for the SiO clouds. The hydrogen density \( n(\text{H}_2) \) is determined from the ratios \( R_{32} = I(\text{SiO}(3–2))/I(\text{SiO}(2–1)) \) and \( R_{54} = I(\text{SiO}(5–4))/I(\text{SiO}(3–2)) \), derived by MP99 using single-dish 30m spectra. MP99 reported minimal evidence of density decline within the central \( r \sim 20 \, \arcsec \) region, obtaining an average \( n(\text{H}_2) = 5 \times 10^5 \, \text{cm}^{-3} \) under the assumption of a uniform filling factor across the three lines. This value is used as representative for both SiO and \( \text{H}^{13}\text{CO}^+ \) in our model. While a hotter component (\( T_K \sim 100 \, \text{K} \)) may exist in the nucleus (as suggested by Mauersberger et al. 1990), the derived \( n(\text{H}_2) \) from SiO line ratios is relatively insensitive to the assumed kinetic temperature when \( T_K > 50 \, \text{K} \).

While the majority of the emission originates from the double ringed structure (I-II), additional gas has been identified outside the x-axis, particularly within the CND structure aligned with the minor axis, which is partially resolved. Although some of this emission can be attributed to the gas distribution in the CND disk, as observed in projection (noting that NGC 253 is not fully edge-on), significant portions lie far from the NIR bar’s major axis. These areas correspond to gas clouds exhibiting highly non-circular motions and a notably high relative abundance of SiO (with T _subscript{mb} (SiO)/T _subscript{mb} (H ^superscript{13}CO ^superscript{+}) = 3-5). Specifically, the SiO emission channels in Figure 2 within the velocity range of [284-335 km s⁻¹] reveal receding gas (v - v _subscript{sys} = 80 km s⁻¹; where v _subscript{sys} = 235 km s⁻¹) in the SE quadrant, where gas should instead be approaching. As discussed further, this anomalous emission is linked to the detected giant outflow in X-ray and optical emission lines, which is distinct from the I-II structure. However, a H ^superscript{13}CO ^superscript{+} clump at approximately (x,y) ∼ (1,8) lacks a SiO counterpart and, unlike the anomalous component, may represent disk gas seen in projection. This clump exhibits a low T _subscript{mb} (SiO)/T _subscript{mb} (H ^superscript{13}CO ^superscript{+}) ratio (∼0.3) and lies near the galaxy’s minor axis at velocities close to v _subscript{sys}.

The high gas-to-dust mass ratio means that the H \textsubscript{2} mass has probably been overestimated by a factor of 2–3 in the center of NGC 6764, when using the standard conversion factor X $\sim X^{std}_{CO}$ . This overestimate may be even more severe in the nucleus because of the intense starburst. Thus we estimate the total H \textsubscript{2} mass to be 7 $\times 10^{8}\mbox{$\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$}$ , taking into account the filtered out flux in the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) interferometric map.

5 Outflow

The basic morphological parameters for the outflow from the 20 cm radio continuum observations are: a projected base of radius 3.5″(540 pc) and a projected height of 7″(1080 pc) above the galaxy plane. The mass-load in the outflow is estimated from the spatial distribution of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission. The \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission was integrated in the area shown in Fig. 2 only for the northern part of the outflow. The area was chosen in order to avoid the contamination from the molecular gas emission in the disk, given the inclination of the galaxy and the spatial resolution of the observations. The \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) integrated intensity in the out-of-plane outflow is 1.4 Jy km s \textsuperscript{-1} .

If the molecular CND is locally disrupted and entrained by the hot wind out of the plane, the geometries of the working surfaces for molecular and ionized gas should align. Schulz and Wegner’s model specifies an expansion velocity of 390 kms⁻¹ for the conical outflow and a half-opening angle of 25°. Projection effects along the line of sight would result in two velocities at each outflow position (N or S). The emission from the S(N) filament should appear at v_rad = -10 kms⁻¹ (120 kms⁻¹) or v_rad = 300 kms⁻¹ (440 kms⁻¹). The observed velocities in the SiO lines for the N (v_rad = 100 kms⁻¹) and S filaments (300 kms⁻¹) corroborate Schulz and Wegner’s model, which was initially developed to explain the observed line-splitting in optical lines. Turner (1985) first identified a molecular gas ejection event in the NGC 253 nucleus. However, the OH plume’s location does not match the morphology and kinematics of the ionized or molecular outflow: the OH gas is ejected from the nucleus toward the NE quadrant (along PA = 6°) and reaches a height of ~1 kpc (see Fig. 11 of Turner (1985) for details).

Two primary processes are considered significant in shaping the chemistry of molecular material within starburst regions: the photodissociation of gas caused by the intense UV radiation from OB associations and the presence of strong shock waves. These shocks can arise locally during mass-loss events in young stars, often observed as bipolar outflows, or on a broader scale from supernova explosions or spiral/barred density waves. Notably, the abundance ratio X(SiO) exhibits substantial variation across the Galaxy, differing by several orders of magnitude depending on the molecular cloud type and location. Specifically, star-forming clouds have X(SiO) values of approximately 10⁻⁷ to 10⁻⁸, while galactic center clouds that do not appear to form stars show X(SiO) around 10⁻⁹, and quiescent clouds exhibit X(SiO) less than 10⁻¹².

To further study the energy budget, we computed the total thermal energy $E_{x}$ in the hot X-ray gas, which was determined by the HRI ROSAT instrument. The X-ray emission is composed by two components: one varying on the timescale of several days and a more diffuse one which extends up to 15″ from the nucleus, roughly along the minor axis (Schinnerer et al. 2000). We make use of the X-ray parameters derived by Eckart et al. (1996) from the ROSAT observations in the 0.1–2.4 keV band. They estimated an electron density $n_{e}\sim 0.2f_{s}^{-1/2}\mbox{cm}^{-3}$ , where $f_{s}$ is the volume filling factor, the volume of the extended X-ray gas as $V\sim 7\times 10^{63}\mbox{cm}^{3}$ , and the temperature of the X-ray gas as $T\sim 4\times 10^{6}$ K. The total thermal energy is then given by $E_{x}\sim 3n_{e}kTVf_{s}$ , i.e. $E_{x}\sim 2.3\times 10^{54}f_{s}^{1/2}$ ergs. We use $f_{s}=0.01$ , as was found for the starburst galaxy NGC 3256 (Heckman et al. 1990; Moran et al. 1999). Thus $E_{x}$ is estimated to be $\sim 2.3\times 10^{53}$ ergs. The current starburst in NGC 6764 appears to be capable of releasing sufficient energy to power the hot X-ray gas bubble.

To estimate the distribution of the radio continuum emission at 20 cm in the outflow bubble, the nuclear component has been subtracted by fitting a Gaussian to the nuclear flux above a threshold of 4 mJy beam \textsuperscript{-1} . The total flux remaining in the center-subtracted map is 63 mJy, or about 60% of the total seen in the VLA observation. There is an offset of the centroid of the outflow emission relative to the position of the nuclear radio continuum peak, and relative to the disk plane. This offset can be due to various reasons: a) the starburst is located in the western part of the nucleus, and slightly below the plane, as suggested by the lower gas column density south of the nucleus, b) there is a possible contribution from a radio jet in the southern part in addition to the starburst-induced outflow.

6 Discussion

Shocks in bipolar outflows are known to significantly increase the gas-phase abundance of SiO, reaching levels as high as approximately 10\textsuperscript{-7} in extreme cases (Martín-Pintado et al. 1992). While the starburst region I could be characterized as a large PDR (Carral et al. 1994), the observed high SiO abundances and the dense structures of SiO clouds suggest that much of the emission originates in bipolar outflows driven by young massive stars, similar to those seen in Galactic regions like W51 and W49. Additionally, the unusually high ratio of I([SiII])/I([OI]) ≈ 1 observed in the central region of NGC 253 points to an enhancement of silicon in the gas phase. Carral et al. (1994) interpreted this as evidence for grain destruction in the starburst environment, likely caused by shocks associated with massive star formation.

The NSB in NGC 6764 is very similar to the NSB in NGC 2782 (Jogee et al. 1998, 1999). However, NGC 2782 has no nuclear activity, apart from the starburst. The CO spurs in NGC 2782 have a total molecular gas mass of $2\times 10^{7}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ , a total molecular gas kinetic energy of $\sim 8\times 10^{53}$ ergs, and a thermal energy of $\sim 2\times 10^{56}f^{0.5}$ . These numbers are larger by factors of 5–10 compared to the energy released in NGC 6764. Nevertheless the size of the outflows is comparable. This is probably due to the lower ISM density in NGC 6764 than in NGC 2782.

The abundance of silicon monoxide (SiO) within the circumnuclear disk (CND) is notably elevated, with an average fractional value of $<$ X(SiO) $>\sim$ 1.5 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10}. This observed abundance surpasses typical predictions for photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) by more than an order of magnitude. Spatial variations in X(SiO) are pronounced, ranging from approximately 1–2 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10} in the inner starburst region, which contributes predominantly to the overall emission, to values as high as a few 10 \textsuperscript{-9} in the outer regions. Elevated SiO abundance is similarly noted within the outflowing gas, where X(SiO) reaches levels of 3–5 $\times$ 10 \textsuperscript{-10}. The discrepancies in chemical composition across the nucleus are hypothesized to result from diverse physical processes. Key mechanisms under consideration include large-scale shocks, which are likely triggered by the orbital dynamics of dense clouds near the outer inner Lindblad resonance (oILR) in the outer regions, as well as shocks generated by the ejection of hot gas in outflows. These processes are considered the most effective in enhancing silicon abundance within the nuclear environment.

HS06 present a compilation of 10 galaxies with non-thermal bubbles that shows that all are associated with an AGN. They link the origin of these bubbles to the presence of an AGN. We note that 6 galaxies of their sample (60 %) have a FIR luminosity larger than the one of NGC 6764, if we adopt their luminosities. The presence of an AGN may not be sufficient to create these bubbles. It may indicate that the association of a starburst, present or recent, with an AGN could be the key to generate non-thermal radio bubbles. The creation of such feature would depend on a short time scale combination of the two processes: the starburst and the AGN. Nevertheless we note that the presence of radio AGN is very low in spiral galaxies (J. Sabater, private communication) which makes the correlation between radio-AGN and non-thermal bubble very significant. Thus a statistical study with a large sample of galaxy with non-thermal bubbles would help to disentangle their origins.

NGC 6764, like other composite galaxies with a nuclear starburst and an AGN, shows that the molecular gas evolution in the very center is mainly driven by the starburst, especially in the molecular outflow. Even if the AGN has an active role in the central evolution, as shown by the gas chemistry in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 (Usero et al. 2004), the only possible influences of the AGN on the molecular gas, at the resolution of the observations of the CO emission in NGC 6764, appears to be the high CO line ratio in the very center, and likely the high HCN/CO ratio already found by Kohno et al. (2001). No clear dynamic signature is observed. The AGN are able to inject vast amounts of energy into their host galaxies and should have a disruptive influence on the molecular gas in the central regions.

7 Summary

We have found the following results from our high-resolution mapping of the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) and \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) millimetre lines and 3.5 and 20 cm radio continuum emission in the circumnuclear area of the NSB galaxy NGC 6764.

1. The bulk of the \textsuperscript{12} CO emission is concentrated in the very center of NGC 6764 and is offset from the 20 cm radio continuum peak by $\sim 1\aas@@fstack{\prime\prime}2$ (with respect to the \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission peak). A more extended component is detected along the bar on the western side of the nucleus. 2. Non-thermal radio continuum emission at 3.5 and 20 cm is observed above and below the galactic plane in a nuclear bubble-like outflow, as already shown by HS06 and Laine et al. (2006). This outflow is detected out to z=1.3 kpc above the galactic plane (deprojected). \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) emission is detected at the NE boundary of the outflow. About $4.3\times 10^{6}\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mbox{$\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$}$ of molecular gas is driven by the outflow out of the plane of the galaxy. 3. The total molecular gas mass is $6.7\times 10^{8}\mbox{$\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$}$ using a CO-to-H \textsubscript{2} conversion factor equal to 1/3 of the Galactic value. The use of such a value is motivated by the large gas-to-dust mass ratio and previous studies of molecular gas in starburst galaxies. 4. The \textsuperscript{12} CO(2–1) / \textsuperscript{12} CO(1–0) line ratio was computed in each channel (10 km s \textsuperscript{-1} velocity width). It reaches a maximum of 1–2 at the nucleus, and is likely associated with the nuclear AGN (it coincides with the 20 cm radio continuum peak). In the bulk of the molecular gas the maximum ratio is about 1–1.3, consistent with warm (T ${}_{kin}\geq 20\leavevmode\nobreak\$ K) and dense gas ( $n_{\mbox{H${}_{2}$}}>2\times 10^{4}\mbox{cm}^{-3}$ ), as found by Eckart et al. (1991). 5. An important fraction of the radio continuum at 3.5 cm is thermal. The outflow morphology and the ISM properties indicate an age of $\sim$ 3–7 Myr for the recent starburst, by comparing the observations to hydrodynamical simulations. It appears that the outflow is still confined and not freely expanding. A “hot-spot” of thermal gas with a flat spectral index ( $\sim-0.2$ ) is located near the northern boundary of the bubble/outflow. 6. The kinetic and thermal energies of the molecular and hot gas components in the bubble can be fully accounted for by the energy released from the NSB, even if the data cannot exclude the AGN from being the major energy source.
