Abstract

We introduce a high–temperature droplet epitaxy procedure, based on the control of the arsenization dynamics of nanoscale droplets of liquid Ga on GaAs(111)A surfaces. The use of high temperatures for the self-assembly of droplet epitaxy quantum dots solves major issues related to material defects, introduced during the droplet epitaxy fabrication process, which limited its use for single and entangled photon sources for quantum photonics applications. We identify the region in the parameter space which allows quantum dots to self–assemble with the desired emission wavelength and highly symmetric shape while maintaining a high optical quality. The role of the growth parameters during the droplet arsenization is discussed and modelled.

I Introduction

The fabrication of high purity single and entangled photon sources is crucial for the development of quantum communication protocols [1] and quantum computation [3] , and it is a fundamental requirement for the realization of repeaters capable of transferring quantum entanglement over long distances [5] . Among the different light emitting platforms, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are very attractive, as they can be integrated with other photonic and electronic components in miniaturized chips. Single photon and entangled photon emitters have been fabricated by QDs using self-assembly techniques like Stranski-Krastanov and Droplet Epitaxy (DE) [7] . In particular, DE enables a fine tuning of the shape, size, density, and thus, of the emission wavelength of the nanostructures [8] with an emission range extending from 700 nm to 1.5 $\mu$ m [12] .

The high symmetry (111) surface, due to its C \textsubscript{3v} symmetry, is optimal to reduce the fine structure splitting (FSS) [13] , but problematic for the growth via Stranski-Krastanov growth mode, since on (111) the relaxation of a strained III-V semiconductor epilayer immediately proceeds through the nucleation of misfit dislocation at the interface rather than through the formation of coherent 3D islands [16] . DE is able to self–assemble highly symmetric QDs on (111)A substrate, capable of polarization-entangled photon emission with very high fidelity [17] . Moreover, the choice of GaAs QDs allows a fast radiative recombination and a weaker impact of spin dephasing mechanisms [18] .

Single epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) are robust and reliable sources of quantum light, widely utilized in quantum optics and quantum technology experiments (1). To maintain the optical quality of QDs fabricated via self-assembly Stranski-Krastanow methods, a capping layer exceeding 50 nm is typically applied (3). The emission properties of QDs can be controlled by coupling them to confined or propagating modes, such as those from optical cavities or waveguides, in cavity quantum electrodynamics setups (4). Another effective method for controlling the emission of solid-state light sources involves coupling them to confined plasmonic modes (5). However, due to the short (nanometer-scale) effective range of plasmonic modes, emitters like fluorescent molecules or colloidal quantum dots are usually deposited on devices using spin coating or drop casting to ensure proximity to the localized electromagnetic field (6). Despite this, these emitters often exhibit limited optical stability, which restricts the scope and duration of experiments. For epitaxial single quantum dots to couple with near-field confined modes, their proximity to the metal-dielectric interface, where the plasmonic mode exists, must be within a few nanometers (7). This requirement has hindered their use in plasmonic experiments due to the presence of a thick ( $>$ 50 nm) capping layer, which preserves their optical quality. Previous attempts to observe plasmonic effects with quantum dots, such as using droplet quantum dots with a 50 nm capping layer in cathodoluminescence, were unsuccessful due to suboptimal optical quality and the thick capping layer preventing observable plasmonic coupling (8,9). We have developed GaAs droplet quantum dots with a significantly thinner (11 nm) capping layer and characterized their structural and optical properties. Our results demonstrate that this technique produces stable emitters with good optical quality, making them ideal candidates for investigating plasmonic and near-field effects.

The optical properties of quantum dots (QDs) are significantly influenced by their size, shape, and density, making these parameters essential for optimizing QD growth for quantum photonics applications. Droplet epitaxy has been employed to produce low-density QDs (10), though this technique typically necessitates a post-annealing step, such as rapid thermal annealing, to enhance the crystallinity of the droplet QDs (12). While growing QDs at elevated substrate temperatures improves their optical characteristics, this approach can lead to deformation or even the disappearance of QDs due to thermal effects. To mitigate this issue, a thin capping layer can be applied to prevent shape alteration during high-temperature growth (13). We introduce an internal thermal heating (ITH) process, which offers advantages over rapid thermal annealing by enabling annealing within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. The ITH method also provides superior control over the size and shape of QDs. Additionally, capping layers can be deposited at the ITH temperature, which is higher than the temperature at which GaAs droplet QDs are formed. The ITH process further allows precise control of QD height, a critical factor for carrier quantum confinement. Moreover, leveraging the strain-free nature of GaAs droplet QDs on AlGaAs, this method facilitates the growth of ultra-thin capping layers, measuring only a few nanometers in thickness.

II Experimental Details

The growth experiments were performed in a conventional Gen II MBE system, on epiready GaAs (111)A substrates. The optimal control of the As flux during the growth was assured by a valved cell. The cracking zone temperature of the As cell was set in every experiment at 600 \textsuperscript{∘} C in order to provide As \textsubscript{4} molecules.

After the oxide desorption at 580 \textsuperscript{∘} C, an atomically smooth surface was prepared by growing a 100 nm thick GaAs buffer layer and a 50 nm Al \textsubscript{0.3} Ga \textsubscript{0.7} As barrier layer after reducing the temperature to 520 \textsuperscript{∘} C. To achieve a smooth surface with minimal surface roughness (RMS below 0.5 nm), growth conditions were kept according to [29] . The RHEED pattern clearly showed a (2 $\times$ 2) surface reconstruction [30] .

The substrate temperature was then decreased to 450 \textsuperscript{∘} C and the As valve closed in order to deplete the growth chamber from the arsenic molecules. When the background pressure reached a value below $1\times 10^{-9}$ Torr, a Ga flux with a rate of 0.01 ML/s was supplied to the substrate surface to form Ga droplets. During the Ga supply the surface reconstruction did not show any change. One sample with Ga droplets, from now on D, was then removed from the growth chamber.

For the other samples, in order to study the influence of substrate temperature and As flux during the crystallization on the QD formation, the substrate temperature was decreased to low temperature, 200 \textsuperscript{∘} C (sample L1) or medium temperature, 400 \textsuperscript{∘} C (sample M1) or increased to high temperature, 500 \textsuperscript{∘} C (all the samples of H series) and then the Ga droplets irradiated with As flux for 5 minutes. The irradiated As beam equivalent pressure (BEP) is reported in table 1 with all the parameters used for the QD formation.

A second set of samples was then prepared using the same recipe of the first set, but capping the nanostructures with a 10 nm of AlGaAs barrier layer grown at 500 \textsuperscript{∘} C, another 40 nm at 520 \textsuperscript{∘} C and a GaAs capping layer of 5 nm. This second set will be recognized adding a C at the end of the sample name.

We characterize the emission properties of the droplet quantum dots (QDs) using photoluminescence imaging (20) and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy (for additional details on the experimental setup, refer to Ref. (21)). By illuminating the sample with a 455 nm light-emitting diode at cryogenic temperatures, we evaluate the wide-field photoluminescence, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The presence of several single emitters confirms that most of the QDs are optically active. We then isolate individual emitters and excite them with a 405 nm continuous-wave laser, focusing the excitation spot to approximately 2 μm in diameter. The emitted light is directed to a grating spectrometer, and an example of the resulting micro-photoluminescence spectrum, captured using a silicon charge-coupled device, is shown in Fig. 3b. Sharp emission lines with linewidths as narrow as 0.175 nm (as highlighted in the inset of Fig. 3b) are observed at wavelengths near 730 nm. These findings demonstrate that GaAs islands with ultra-thin capping layers enable quantum confinement of carriers and stable emission in the near-infrared spectral range. However, reducing the capping layer thickness brings the emitters closer to surface states, which can lead to line broadening (22). Notably, linewidths an order of magnitude narrower have been reported for droplet quantum dots buried beneath a 100 nm-thick capping layer (23). Yet, such emitters would be impractical for surface near-field applications due to their increased distance from the surface. To assess the brightness of the sources, we vary the excitation power and plot the emission intensity (defined as photon flux at the first lens, accounting for the setup's transmission, measured to be ~9.2%) as a function of laser pump power, as shown in Fig. 3c. These results are consistent across different excitation runs and cooldowns, confirming the stability of light emission from these droplet QDs, even with a very thin capping layer.

III Results

The AFM characterization of sample D, on which only Ga deposition was performed, shows the formation of Ga droplets with spherical cup shape (see panel a of figure 1 ). The density of the droplets is approximately $7\times 10^{8}$ cm \textsuperscript{-2} , the diameter is 50.4 $\pm$ 7.0 nm and the height 7.4 $\pm$ 1.1 nm, the contact angle is approximately 33.7 \textsuperscript{∘} . The shape of the droplet is perfectly symmetric, without elongation in any crystallographic direction. Simple calculations considering the volume of the droplets, the density, and the amount of the deposited Ga, demonstrate with good agreement that all the gallium is collected inside the droplets. This is in agreement with the fact that (111)A surface is Ga terminated and the Ga excess, during gallium deposition, immediately creates droplets on the surface.

Through an investigation utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM), the morphological characteristics of quantum dots (QDs) as a function of the in-situ thermal healing (ITH) temperature were analyzed. The findings reveal that the height of GaAs QDs is significantly influenced by the ITH process, while their width and density remain largely unaffected (as illustrated in Fig. 1b, c, d). Specifically, the height of GaAs islands begins to diminish when the ITH temperature reaches approximately 500°C. At 563°C, the height of GaAs islands is measured to be 8.7 ± 3.4 nm, with a corresponding width of 104.2 ± 13.4 nm. These QDs are subsequently encapsulated with an 11 nm-thick AlGaAs layer, as shown in Fig. 1b. 

As demonstrated in Fig. 2b, the width of GaAs islands remains nearly constant compared to Ga droplets (labeled as "Metal") and unheated GaAs islands (labeled as "No heating"). Notably, the height of GaAs islands is approximately twice that of Ga droplets and exhibits a decreasing trend as the ITH temperature surpasses 500°C. These observations are corroborated by the aspect ratios (height/width) presented in Fig. 1c, which indicate that the ITH process primarily alters the height of GaAs islands, causing a flattening of their tops post-annealing, consistent with prior studies (16). The elongated shape of the quantum dots is attributed to the differing diffusivity of Ga along [110] and [1-10] directions on GaAs(001), as previously reported (17).

The distribution density of Ga droplets, GaAs islands, and ITH GaAs islands, as depicted in Fig. 1d, is observed to be uniform across all three species, with a density of approximately 6 droplets or islands per square micrometer (see also Fig. 2c). Regarding droplet epitaxial growth, the density of GaAs islands remains largely unaffected after crystallization at low substrate temperatures. However, the density of Ga droplets exhibits a significant variation depending on substrate temperature, a phenomenon explainable by Ostwald ripening. This process involves the growth of larger clusters at the expense of smaller ones, leading to a decrease in overall density. Interestingly, no substantial density change is noted for ITH GaAs islands, even though elevated substrate temperatures can accelerate Ostwald ripening (18). The findings suggest that GaAs droplet islands can withstand an ITH temperature of approximately 500 °C without an increase in droplet size at the expense of smaller islands, though there is a notable reduction in material from the island tops.

In order to study the role of Ga adatom diffusion and incorporation during droplet arsenization, we analyzed the AFM images and measured the total volume of GaAs crystallized inside the QDs after the arsenization, as reported in table 1 . An important parameter of the DE–QDs which helps to elucidate the actual processes during the droplet crystallization is the ratio $\gamma=V_{1}/V$ between the volume of the final QDs ( $V_{1}$ ) and the GaAs volume available ( $V$ ) by the complete crystallization of the Ga contained in the droplets. It quantitatively sets the difference between a two–dimensional growth, where the droplet have the role of local group III reservoirs [31] and $\gamma=0$ , and the three–dimensional crystallization of the QD inside the original droplet. The experimental dependence of $\gamma$ on As flux ( $J_{\rm As}$ ) and crystallization temperature $T$ is reported in Figure 4 . The measured GaAs crystallized inside the QDs is always lower from the expected volume considering the initial Ga volume stored in the droplets, except for sample L1. The total volume of GaAs crystallized inside the QDs decreases with increasing arsenization temperature and with decreasing $J_{\rm As}$ .

Another important fabrication step, which affects the optical properties of the QDs, is the capping procedure. We used ensemble PL to investigate samples L1C, H1C and H4C as shown in figure 5 in black, red and blue, respectively. The peak around either 640 or 650 nm is related to AlGaAs barrier, whereas the emission bands at 650–690, 660–705 and 700–765 nm, for samples L1C, H1C and H4C respectively, are related to QD emission. The distribution of the emission energy shows sizable modulations which are typical of QDs with low aspect ratio and can be attributed to monolayer fluctuations in height [24] .

IV Discussion

We fabricate GaAs droplet epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) on Al₀.₃Ga₀.₇As/GaAs substrates and employ an in-situ thermal healing (ITH) process to adjust the morphologies of the QDs and improve their optical characteristics. The growth sequence is illustrated in Fig. 1a. Following deoxidation at approximately 600°C under As₄, a 50 nm-thick Al₀.₃Ga₀.₇As layer is deposited on a ~200 nm-thick GaAs buffer layer. For comparative purposes, surface Ga droplets, GaAs droplet islands without ITH, and GaAs islands with an ITH step are grown. The growth parameters for Ga droplets include a substrate temperature of 321°C, 2 Ga monolayer (ML) coverage, and a Ga flux equivalent to a GaAs growth rate of 0.5 ML/s. To ensure uniform growth, a 10 s growth interruption is implemented after depositing the Ga droplets. An As₄ flux of 1 × 10⁻⁵ Torr is introduced onto the liquid Ga droplets near room temperature after cooling. The ITH temperature (TITH) is varied between 300–580°C, and the ITH process required for GaAs island formation is conducted for 10 minutes under an As₄ flux of 6 × 10⁻⁶ Torr. As previously demonstrated (14), the ITH step induces a blue-shift in the emission wavelength of the quantum dots by modifying the shape and size of the emitters. A 11 nm-thick Al₀.₃Ga₀.₇As capping layer is subsequently deposited on the GaAs islands after the ITH process: an initial 8 nm-thick layer is deposited at 563°C, followed by an additional 3 nm-thick layer at 580°C. Typically, the initial capping layer is deposited at a lower substrate temperature to prevent QD deformation. However, low-temperature capping can degrade the optical quality of the emitters. In our case, depositing the capping layer at an ITH temperature of 563°C reduces defect formation and narrows the emission linewidth of confined excitons (15), offering a pathway to enhance the optical properties of low-density GaAs droplet epitaxial QDs for quantum photonic applications.

The study presents findings on the growth and optical characterization of GaAs quantum dots, featuring exceptionally thin (11 nm) capping layers. A key innovation in the growth process involves the implementation of an internal thermal heating step, whose impact on the structural properties of the quantum dots was analyzed using scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Photoluminescence measurements conducted at cryogenic temperatures revealed highly stable, intense, and narrow emission from individual quantum dots in the near-infrared region. The exceptional optical properties of these quantum dots, combined with their close proximity to the surface, make them highly suitable for exploring near-field effects, such as coupling with plasmonic modes. This capability could enable precise control over the emission directionality and spontaneous emission rate, both of which are essential for advancing quantum photonic technologies.

During the development process, the ITH procedure is executed within an As\textsubscript{4} environment maintained at a pressure of 6 × 10\textsuperscript{-6} Torr. This atmosphere prevents the significant distortion of GaAs islands caused by the re-evaporation of As\textsubscript{4} during heating. As demonstrated in Figures 1b, c, and d, the vertical dimension of GaAs islands can be precisely regulated through ITH without inducing substantial changes to their lateral dimensions or concentration. Given the ability to adjust the height of ITH-derived GaAs islands, the deposition of ultra-thin capping layers that retain quantum confinement effects is anticipated to be feasible.

By increasing the As BEP up to $5\times 10^{-5}$ torr at high substrate temperature, it is possible to obtain again QDs with hexagonal symmetrical shape. A graphical representation is reported in panel c of figure 2 . Here we consider the shape and the mean size measured for the original gallium droplet (orange) and we compared it with the shape and the mean size measured for the QDs on sample H4 (dark green). From panel c can also be observed that on sample H4 all the sides of the hexagonal dots are away but at the same distance from the base circle of the original droplet. This means that in these arsenization conditions the incorporation of Ga adatoms along A and B steps, has comparable speeds.

We conducted a study to examine the development of GaAs/Al<sub>0.3</sub>Ga<sub>0.7</sub>As droplet epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) synthesized using an in situ thermal healing (ITH) process. The size and density of ITH GaAs QDs were analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM), and their optical characteristics were evaluated through micro-photoluminescence measurements.

The droplet quantum dots (QDs) described here are particularly well-suited for exploring near-field plasmonic phenomena. This is achieved by integrating metallic components such as rings, bowtie antennas, or cubes to amplify photon emission or light-matter interaction. Unlike conventional fluorescent emitters, which include materials like $J$-aggregates, dye molecules, and quantum dots, these droplet QDs offer distinct advantages. They provide sharp emission lines and stable properties due to a protective capping layer, which preserves their performance under laser exposure, environmental interaction, or temperature fluctuations. These features make them ideal for examining near-field effects and potential energy transfer between single emitters and confined or propagating optical modes. Additionally, the thin capping layer simplifies emitter localization, as demonstrated in Fig. 2, enabling straightforward implementation of techniques such as combined photoluminescence and atomic force microscopy to analyze growth traits or integrate single emitters into tailored photonic structures.

On GaAs (111)A substrates, the geometry of the fabricated nanostructure is different due to different symmetry, and we observe compact islands for all the measured parameter range.

In Fig. 2b, the visibility of GaAs islands under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is demonstrated, owing to their proximity to the surface. This enables straightforward deterministic integration into nanophotonic devices using SEM techniques originally developed for buried InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) (19). The QDs exhibit an elliptically elongated shape along the (1 -1 0) direction, with surface features characterized by a height of 3.8 ± 1.0 nm and a long-axis width of 208.3 ± 42.5 nm. Fig. 2c and 2d present AFM images of GaAs islands capped with an 11 nm-AlGaAs layer, acquired in tapping mode using a silicon cantilever with a tetrahedral, point-terminated tip. The cantilever features a tip radius of 7 nm, a spring constant of 26 N/m, and a resonance frequency of 300 kHz (nominal values). A density of approximately 6 QDs/μm² is observed, and given the average height (8.7 ± 3.4 nm) and width (104.2 ± 13.4 nm) of the QDs prior to capping, the actual distance between the QD and the surface is merely a few nanometers, as shown in Fig. 2a.

In figure 4 we reported the data related to parameter $\gamma$ for the temperature series (L1, M1 and H1, from the top down in right panel) and for the As pressure series (from H0 to H5, from left to right, left panel). Considering the temperature series, it is possible to see that on sample L1 almost all the gallium is crystallized inside the hexagonal QDs, while on samples M1 and H1 a loss of about 46% and 91% of the original gallium deposited is measured. Considering the samples of As pressure series, arsenized at 500 \textsuperscript{∘} C with different As fluxes from $8\times 10^{-7}$ to $7\times 10^{-5}$ Torr, it is also consistently observed a loss in volume. The value of $\gamma$ is increasing with the equivalent pressure of As irradiated during the droplet crystallization. For this series the loss in volume of GaAs crystallized inside the QDs is between 50% and 93%. It is interesting to notice that, on (111)A surface, the possibility of a loss of material outside the final nanostructure was already observed for InAs QDs grown by DE in [37] .

To understand the observed behavior we have to consider how the droplet arsenization and the diffusion processes depend on the growth parameters. Let us first assume the droplet crystallization mechanism depends on the liquid–solid interface area, the arsenic solubility and diffusivity into the droplet and $J_{\rm As}$ . Considering, as first order approximation, a slow dependence of the interface area on the growth time (process 1 in figure 3 , the volume crystallized inside the droplet depends linearly on growth time $t$ via the equation 
 
 $V_{1}(t)=\rho_{D}J_{\rm As}t$  (1) 
 where $\rho_{D}$ is the constant that takes into account all the other factors (the arsenic solubility and diffusivity into the droplet) with the exception of the As flux $J_{\rm As}$ .

The droplet quantum dots (QDs) developed here are well-suited for investigating near-field plasmonic phenomena, particularly when paired with metallic nanostructures such as rings (24), bowtie antennas (25), or cubes (26), which enhance photon emission brightness or light-matter interaction. Unlike conventional fluorescent emitters (27), including $J$-aggregates, dye molecules, and colloidal quantum dots, which are commonly employed in plasmonic studies, these droplet QDs provide sharp emission lines and stable emission characteristics. The protective capping layer ensures that these properties remain intact even after prolonged laser exposure, environmental interaction, or thermal cycling. Consequently, these emitters are anticipated to facilitate the exploration of near-field effects and coherent energy transfer between single emitters and confined or propagating near-field optical modes. Furthermore, the thin capping layer simplifies determination of the QD position, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. This enables straightforward integration of techniques like combined photoluminescence and atomic force microscopy (28) to analyze growth characteristics or precisely embed single emitters within tailored photonic devices.

Understanding the relationship between the growth parameters and the shape of the nanostructures is fundamental for the fabrication of emitters with specific electronic and optical properties but it is then necessary to evaluate the effect of the deposition of the AlGaAs capping layer in terms of shape change and interdiffusion. The optical properties of the QDs capped with 50 nm Al \textsubscript{0.3} Ga \textsubscript{0.7} As and 5 nm of GaAs were studied by means of ensemble photoluminescence (PL) and single-band constant-potential model simulations on the second set of sample. As expected from simple considerations of quantum confinement energy, the size of the QDs, and in particular their height, is affecting the emission wavelength. The ensemble PL spectra of samples L1C, H1C and H4C are displayed in black, red and blue, respectively, in Fig. 5 . We simulated the expected radiative recombination energies with the single-band constant-potential model [41] , using realistic dot shapes from the AFM images taken from the corresponding uncapped samples and linear dimensions given by average values from the experimental size distribution. The band parameters used in the calculation [42] are chosen consistently with previous studies on droplet epitaxy GaAs/AlGaAs QDs. The results for the ground state transition are shown by arrows in Fig. 5 alongside the ensemble PL spectra. It is worth notice that for the samples in which the substrate temperature during the QDs crystallization was set equal or higher than 400 \textsuperscript{∘} C, a small blueshift around 30 meV was found between the theoretical estimation and the centroid of the energy distribution. For a substrate temperature of 200 \textsuperscript{∘} C during the As crystallization (sample L1C), a blueshift larger than 200 meV was measured. This large discrepancy is attributed to sizeable interdiffusion at the AlGaAs/GaAs interface during the capping step, when the temperature is substantially increased up to 500 \textsuperscript{∘} C and the nanostructure is slowly covered with an AlGaAs layer. We observe the presence of interdiffusion during the deposition of the capping layer in all our samples. However only in sample L1, where droplet are crystallized at 200 \textsuperscript{∘} C, the interdiffusion has a strong impact. On the contrary, the QDs crystallized at $T>400\ ^{\circ}$ C show a limited blue–shift. Theoretical predictions simulating QDs with and without interdiffusion at the boundaries, show that this process involves only a few monolayers. The limited impact of capping demonstrates, again, the high crystalline quality of the QDs grown at elevated temperature.

V Conclusions

The high-temperature droplet epitaxy method described enables the self-assembly of quantum dots (QDs) with high optical quality and symmetric shapes, as demonstrated in [22] through exciton linewidth measurements (mean value 15 µeV, best 9 µeV) and fine structure splitting (mean value below 5 µeV). These properties are crucial for creating entanglement-ready photon sources, as shown in [22], where 95% of the emitters were capable of producing photon pairs deterministically with fidelity to the expected Bell state exceeding the classical limit. The enhanced optical quality stems from the high crystalline quality of both the GaAs QDs and the surrounding AlGaAs barrier, which are crystallized and deposited at a temperature near optimal for GaAs growth on a (111)A surface. We analyzed and modeled how QD shape and size depend on parameters during the crystallization process. Our findings reveal that high-temperature droplet epitaxy on (111)A substrates, like standard droplet epitaxy on GaAs(001), is governed by the balance between crystallization within the droplet and the detachment of Ga adatoms from the droplet, followed by their diffusion and incorporation into the surrounding crystal. The dominance of crystallization over adatom detachment facilitates the formation of 3D islands. This occurs on GaAs (111)A substrates at high temperatures due to the low residence time of arsenic on the (111)A surface, which suppresses diffusion and crystallization processes on the crystal surface around the droplet. The high arsenic pressure required for crystallization also ensures equal growth velocities along the A and B steps, resulting in a symmetric hexagonal QD shape. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature preserves the QD shape during capping, enabling reproducible fabrication procedures—a key requirement for the deterministic design of emitters tailored to specific wavelengths.
