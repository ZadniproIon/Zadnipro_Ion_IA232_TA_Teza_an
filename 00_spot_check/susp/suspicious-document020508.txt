Shock Excitation in Interacting Galaxies: Mkn 266

By R. Davies and M. Ward and H. Sugai

Abstract

Our research presents a detailed analysis of the central regions of the cD/AGN galaxy NGC 1275 using H and K band imaging spectroscopy, which encompasses emission lines from various species including H\textsubscript{2}, hydrogen, and iron. By examining these spectral features, we are able to shed light on the mechanisms driving star formation and excitation within the galaxy's nucleus. The observed near-infrared characteristics of NGC 1275 can be primarily attributed to the presence of ionized gas in the narrow-line region, dense molecular gas, and hot dust in close proximity to the active galactic nucleus. Notably, the intense H\textsubscript{2} emission is found to originate predominantly from circumnuclear gas excited by the AGN, rather than from cooling flow processes. Furthermore, the emission from late-type stars is obscured at the center by the thermal radiation emitted by hot dust, while the ratios of iron and hydrogen emission lines are consistent with excitation driven by X-rays from the central AGN.

1 Introduction

NGC 1275 exhibits exceptionally powerful and extended H₂ emission, rivaling that of NGC 6240, with its origin potentially attributed to the cooling flow, although other mechanisms such as fast J-shocks, UV pumping, and X-ray heating from supernovae or active galactic nuclei may also contribute. The presence of substantial quantities of H₂, with masses exceeding 3 × 10⁹ M⊙, in giant molecular clouds within the central regions is likely facilitated by merging events, as evidenced by mm-wave CO observations. These observations also reveal complex gas motions, including large-scale rotation and smaller-scale turbulence, which are associated with merging and cooling flow processes. High-resolution 2.6 mm CO interferometric observations have revealed a ring-like structure, predominantly oriented in the East-West direction, containing approximately 80% of the total CO emission on the western side. Furthermore, deep interferometric observations of the nucleus have yielded no detectable CO absorption from very cold gas, imposing stringent limits on potential mass deposition from a cooling flow.

Another issue which has posed a significant barrier to extragalactic work is the detection of the fainter H \textsubscript{2} lines, which is essential to determine the fractions of H \textsubscript{2} which are thermally and non-thermally excited. Previously, except in a few cases such as NGC 6240 (Sugai et al. 1997b) which has extremely bright 1-0 S(1), this has typically relied on very few line ratios, often given only as upper limits and extracted from rather large apertures (eg Goldader et al. 1997). It is crucial to detect lines from the v=2 (or higher) bands: a single thermal model can nearly always provide a reasonable fit to lines from the v=1-0 transitions. It is also important to have more than one v=2-1 line, since ratios involving only a single such transition can be ambiguous: for temperatures in the range 1500–2500 K, the thermal 2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) ratio varies from 0.03 to 0.15. Thus if a ratio (or upper limit) of 0.15 is observed, while the 1-0 S(1) is constrained to be $>75$ % thermal, the total H \textsubscript{2} cooling can only be attributed to somewhere in the range 35–100% thermal depending solely on a fairly small change in thermal excitation temperature. With the increasing sensitivity of near-infrared detectors it is now possible to use small apertures and obtain the high signal-to-noise spectra required to detect higher vibrational lines. Additionally, fitting the continuum with stellar templates, rather than using a power-law or polynomial fit, is necessary in order to take account of the stellar features and allow weak lines from the excited gas, such as H \textsubscript{2} lines, to be measured reliably.

We address these issues in this paper, in which we present a detailed analysis of near infrared emission line images and spectra. We focus on Mkn 266, a luminous infrared galaxy ( $L_{\rm IR}=3\times 10^{11}\,L_{\odot}$ ) at a distance of 115 Mpc (1″ = 560 pc). It has 2 prominent nuclei 10″ apart, with a common envelope, suggestive of a merger (Mazarella et al. 1988, hereafter MGAH). There have been very few detailed studies of Mkn 266, the two most decisive being those of MGAH and Wang et al (1997). The former authors presented an H $\alpha$ map which revealed arcs that may be tidal tails or remnant spiral structure. They also mapped the radio continuum, which appears similar to the 2 $\mu$ m continuum but with a strong region of extended emission halfway between the nuclei. The latter study found evidence for a superwind in their X-ray imaging and spectroscopic data.

2 Observations and Data Reduction

Images of the 2 $\mu$ m continuum, and 1-0 S(1) and Br $\gamma$ emission lines were obtained with the UKIRT 3.8-m telescope on Mauna Kea, on the nights of 12 and 13 May 1998. A K-band Fabry-Perot etalon (FP), set in a collimated beam, was used in conjunction with IRCAM3 (a $256\times 256$ InSb array) at the Cassegrain focus. The scale of 0.286″ per pixel gave an unvignetted field of view of $\sim$ 60″. Order sorting was achieved with cooled narrow band filters: 2.4% FWHM for the Br $\gamma$ line, and 4.25% FWHM for the 1-0 S(1) line. The latter filter is normally used for continuum imaging, but was required due to the large recession velocity ( $>8000$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} ) of the galaxy which shifted the line out of the standard filter pass-bands. The 325 km s \textsuperscript{-1} spectral resolution of the FP and the wavelength calibration were checked several times during the night using the 2.1171 $\mu$ m line from a Krypton lamp, permitting adjustments for temperature changes (approx. 40 km s \textsuperscript{-1} / \textsuperscript{∘} C).

Utilizing the cutting-edge instrumentation at the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie's 3.5m telescope in Calar Alto, Spain, our observational campaign on January 15, 16, and 21, 1995, employed the innovative 3D imaging spectrometer and the CHARM tip-tilt image tracker, developed by the Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie and the Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik, respectively. By leveraging the CHARM system's capacity to mitigate atmospherically induced image degradation, as described by McCaughrean et al., we were able to generate high-resolution images with enhanced spatial stability, achieving a correction rate of 5 Hz while locked onto the luminous, point-like nucleus of NGC1275. Under variable seeing conditions ranging from 1.0 to 1.7 arcseconds, our final image quality yielded a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1.5 arcseconds, as determined through fitting to the nucleus, in accordance with the methodology outlined by Maoz et al. The 3D instrument, as characterized by Krabbe et al. and Weitzel et al., is a sophisticated field imaging spectrograph capable of capturing H or K band data cubes in a single exposure, with spectral resolutions of R = 1000 and 2000, and a field of view of 8 × 8 arcseconds, comprised of 16 pixels on each side, with a pixel size of 0.5 arcseconds. By implementing a dithering technique, wherein the spectral sampling is shifted by half a pixel in alternating datasets, we attained fully Nyquist-sampled spectra, with an intrinsic spectral sampling of λ/R, resulting in a spectral resolution of 670, equivalent to 450 km s⁻¹, with future software enhancements poised to yield full R = 1000 spectra upon co-addition, thereby underscoring the significant efficiency gains offered by this instrument over traditional long-slit spectrographs, particularly for extended objects, where the entire band spectrum can be obtained at any point within the 8 × 8 arcseconds field.

The observational data, as outlined in Table 1, were collected by alternating between target frames and sky exposures located 60″ west, with spectral calibration observations of featureless reference stars of established brightness conducted immediately before or after each source observation. To refine the calibration, known spectral features in the reference star spectra, such as Br $\gamma$ in the K band and Br9-Br11 in the H band, were removed through interpolation. However, challenges arose during sky subtraction due to a temporally variable CO\textsubscript{2} absorption feature near 2.01 $\mu$m and the presence of variable OH lines in the H band, which introduced significant spurious sky noise across the band.

Spectra obtained for the nucleus within a 3″ aperture are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, showcasing a diverse array of emission and absorption lines in the K and H bands. Notably, the K-band spectrum exhibits a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 70 in the continuum, while the H-band spectrum has a signal-to-noise ratio of around 25 in the continuum.

Flux calibration was achieved with the standard stars BS 4344 (type A4V, K=6.30) and BS 5142 (type A3V, K=5.18). The frames were treated in the same way except that sky frames were subtracted and there was no need to correct for the ripple pattern. The profiles of the order sorting filters were included, making as much as 15% difference from assuming a simple boxcar shape due to secondary FP transmission orders in the wings of the pass-band. The image resolution was determined from the stars to be 0.77″ for the 1-0 S(1) line and 1.34″ for the Br $\gamma$ line.

The spectral profile of the [Fe ii] 1.644 $\mu$ m line defies accurate representation by a single Gaussian distribution, a phenomenon commonly observed in Seyfert galaxies where emission features often exhibit both narrow and broad components. To adequately model the observed profile, we employed a dual-Gaussian fit, comprising a broad component with a velocity width of $1340\pm 120$ km s$^{-1}$ and a relative amplitude of 0.26, alongside a narrower component with a velocity width of $280\pm 20$ km s$^{-1}$. This two-component model (illustrated in Fig. 12) yields an excellent fit, implying that roughly half of the [Fe ii] emission originates from the same region as the Br $\gamma$ line, characterized by a similar linewidth, while the remaining half arises from a region coincident with the H$_2$ emission, where linewidths are similarly comparable. These findings suggest that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of NGC 1275 is likely responsible for a significant portion of the excitation leading to [Fe ii] emission, analogous to the scenario proposed for the H$_2$ lines (Sect. 4.2). Furthermore, drawing parallels with the work of Blietz et al. (1994), who reported a strong correlation between [Fe ii] emission and the narrow-line region (NLR) in NGC 1068, it is plausible that a similar relationship exists in NGC 1275, albeit at a much greater distance and unresolved in our observations.

Spectra of Mkn 266 were obtained as part of the UKIRT service observing programme on May 1 1999 using the CGS4 spectrometer; the orientation of the slit, 33 \textsuperscript{∘} East of North, is indicated on Fig. 1 . The total integration time was 64 min. Frames are sky subtracted, flatfielded, and co-added on-line using CGS4DR; further data reduction was carried out with IRAF. The dispersion axis was aligned to pixel rows, and the spatial axis to pixel columns with reference to an argon arclamp and hence simultaneously calibrating the wavelength scale. Standard A stars (BS 5023 and HD 105601) were used for flux calibration and atmospheric correction after interpolating over Br $\gamma$ and Pa $\alpha$ with Lorentzian profiles and making a small correction to the same airmass as Mkn 266. The spatial resolution was determined from the standard stars to be 1.06″, well matched to 2-pixel sampling. Integrated spectra of each nucleus were extracted in order to look at weak features, and additionally the spatial extent of the brighter features was considered. The heliocentric velocities of the two nuclei were measured as 8440 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (NE) and 8390 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (SW), in good agreement with those of Veilleux et al. (1995).

2.1 Fabry-Perot Images

The emission spectrum of NGC 1275 exhibits a notable anomaly in the Br $\gamma$ line, characterized by a pronounced asymmetry in both its spectral profile and spatial distribution, as evident in Figures 1 and 10. Interestingly, the Br $\gamma$ emission is aligned with the radio jets, which have a position angle of 160 degrees, suggesting that the ionization mechanism is predominantly driven by the central engine rather than the surrounding stellar population. This finding is corroborated by visible band imaging spectroscopy, which reveals a correlation between the Br $\gamma$ emission and the H $\alpha$ and [NII] maps presented by Ferruit & Pecontal. Notably, the extended emission feature in our maps coincides with a peak in H $\alpha$ and [NII] emission, located approximately 1.2 arcseconds north and 0.7 arcseconds west of the nucleus. By analyzing the published H $\alpha$ maps, we estimate the flux in this hotspot to be approximately $1.3 \times 10^{-17}$ W m$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. Furthermore, using the [SII] line ratios and assuming an electron temperature of $10^4$ K, Ferruit & Pecontal derive an electron density of 40 cm$^{-3}$ and a linewidth of 340 km s$^{-1}$ for this region, providing valuable insights into the physical conditions governing this enigmatic emission.

The observed column density of the H₂ 2-1 S(3) line is significantly lower than expected, exhibiting a factor of three reduction compared to extrapolated values based on the 2-1 S(1) and 2-1 S(2) transitions. This discrepancy persists even when considering a non-equilibrium ortho/para ratio within the 2-1 transitions, with the column density of the 2-1 S(3) line remaining more than 2.5 times lower than that of the 2-1 S(1) line, assuming an excitation temperature of 2600 K for the ortho states. A thorough examination of the original data and spectrum reveals no anomalies, and the possibility of line blending with strong absorption can be ruled out, suggesting that the weakness of the H₂ 2-1 S(3) line is a genuine feature. Furthermore, the 2-1 S(1) line also appears weak at a radius of approximately 1 kpc outside the nucleus, with its strength being less than 2.5 times that required for detection, or roughly half the strength of the clearly visible 1-0 S(2) line.

During the data reduction process, a publicly available, digitized stellar library in the H band was nonexistent, prompting the creation of a synthetic continuum spectrum tailored to the stellar population of NGC 1275. This was achieved by aggregating a multitude of black body curves with diverse temperatures, each weighted by the proportional representation of stars exhibiting that specific temperature, thereby generating a continuum spectrum devoid of spectral lines. The H band CO absorption features, being relatively faint, would have had a negligible impact on the fitting process. To facilitate this approach, the galaxy's population was modeled utilizing the stellar population evolution code STARS, which, given a predefined set of input parameters, yields the binned number density function of stars within the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. By summing a series of scaled black body curves at various temperatures, an approximate H-band continuum was derived, mirroring the underlying continuum of NGC 1275, provided that the input parameters for STARS were adequately adjusted. Subsequently, the composite spectrum was normalized to a common wavelength with the K band stellar library spectrum, resulting in the final H and K band stellar spectrum, denoted as $I_{\lambda}^{\text{STAR}}$. To ensure consistency, all K band spectra were calibrated to a wavelength of 2.27 $\mu$m, while H band spectra were calibrated to 1.57 $\mu$m, a wavelength chosen for its lack of spectral lines, thereby providing a reliable baseline for further analysis.

Observations of the central 1 kpc of NGC 1275 using the MPE 3D imaging spectrograph revealed a significant distinction between the core and peripheral regions. The inner 300 pc are characterized by dominant emission from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and hot dust, with no discernible nuclear stellar continuum. In contrast, the regions approximately 1 kpc from the nucleus exhibit emission predominantly from an old stellar population, consistent with a normal population aged over 100 million to 1 billion years. Notably, no evidence supports the transformation of substantial "cooling flow" gas into stars with a low-mass biased initial mass function in this region, although a low-mass population cannot be entirely ruled out due to potential disturbances in the central 10 kpc. Furthermore, emission line ratios in the near-infrared regime within the central 500 pc suggest excitation from a combination of AGN emission and shock excitation, potentially resulting from past mergers or the early stages of a merger between the high-velocity and low-velocity systems.

The emission of [Fe ii] at 1.644 μm from NGC 1275 is exceptionally strong and concentrated at the center, accompanied by other notable iron lines in the H and K bands, including [Fe ii] 1.534 μm, [Fe iii] 2.2178 μm, and [Fe iii] 2.2420 μm. The flux of [Fe ii] 1.644 μm is comparable to that of [Fe ii] 1.257 μm in an 8″ aperture, as reported by Rudy et al. Notably, the [Fe ii] emission in NGC 1275 is significantly stronger relative to other starburst and Seyfert indicators compared to most active galaxies, with a [Fe ii]/Brγ ratio of 6.3 in the central 1 kpc, exceeding that of similar regions in NGC 3256, NGC 4945, and NGC 1068. This suggests that the iron depletion in NGC 1275 is less severe, potentially due to an ambient radiation field that evaporates iron from dust grains or a cool ionizing source that produces low-ionization radiation. Alternatively, fast J-shocks and X-ray heating could also be responsible for the copious [Fe ii] emission, creating reservoirs of partially ionized gas within molecular clouds.

Within the innermost 0.3 kiloparsecs of the galaxy, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is anticipated to dominate the stellar population's contribution. This expectation is borne out by the fact that the continuum emission emanating from the core of NGC 1275 can be accurately modeled by the light emitted by K5 III or K5 I b stars, albeit significantly attenuated by the radiation from hot dust and the characteristic power-law emission associated with AGN activity, as illustrated in Figure 4. The optimal fit parameters yield values of $c_{\textup{STAR}}=0.0\pm 0.1$, $c_{\textup{PL}}=0.5\pm 0.1$, $c_{\textup{HD}}=0.5\pm 0.1$, $T_{\textup{d}}=700\pm 200$, and $\tau_{\textup{K}}=0.05\pm 0.1$, where $c_{\textup{i}}$ denotes the fractional contribution of each component, and the errors are derived from a combination of systematic uncertainties in the spectral data and variations in the weighting and initial parameters used in multiple fitting trials. Notably, the fitting process at the nucleus is overwhelmingly influenced by power-law emission, rendering the spectral features of the underlying stellar population relatively insignificant and precluding distinction between various possible underlying populations. Furthermore, the relative contribution of power-law emission exhibits limited sensitivity to the adopted AGN spectral index, which ranges from -0.5 to -1.5, as its primary role is to mitigate the steep slope of the stellar continuum, approximating a blackbody spectrum.

2.2 Longslit Spectroscopy

Notably, the galaxy NGC 6240 is the only other instance where a weak H₂ 2-1 S(3) line has been observed, albeit with an upper limit reported by Lester et al. Estimates from their data suggest that the column density of this line in NGC 6240 is at least 3.5 times lower than expected, consistent with our findings and implying a potential common underlying mechanism. While the column densities in NGC 6240 are only twice those in NGC 1275, with similar temperature ranges, the excitation conditions differ between the two galaxies, with NGC 6240 exhibiting evidence of UV pumping in addition to X-ray heating, as demonstrated by Draine & Woods and Lester et al. However, recent findings by Sugai et al. have cast doubt on the reported weakness of the H₂ 2-1 S(3) line in NGC 6240, highlighting the need for higher-quality, high-resolution spectroscopic data to resolve this discrepancy.

3 Emission Line Images

In Seyfert galaxies, emission lines often exhibit complex profiles that cannot be accurately represented by a single Gaussian distribution, and the [Fe ii ] 1.644 $\mu$ m  line in this case is no exception. To better understand the observed profile, a two-Gaussian fit was applied, yielding a broad component with a width of approximately 1340 km s\textsuperscript{-1} and a narrower component with a width of around 280 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. This dual-component model provides an excellent fit to the data, suggesting that roughly half of the [Fe ii ] emission originates from the same region as the Br $\gamma$ emission, characterized by similar linewidths, while the remaining half arises from a region associated with H \textsubscript{2} emission, where linewidths are also comparable. These findings imply that the active galactic nucleus of NGC 1275 plays a significant role in exciting the [Fe ii ] emission, similar to its effect on H \textsubscript{2} lines, and draw parallels with the correlation observed between [Fe ii ] emission and the narrow-line region in NGC 1068, although the current case remains unresolved due to its greater distance.

The observed Br $\gamma$ linewidth of $980\pm 30$ km s\textsuperscript{-1} at the nucleus is unusually broad for a star-forming region, suggesting a significant contribution from the narrow-line region (NLR) associated with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The differential extinction effect is likely responsible for the larger linewidth of Br $\gamma$ compared to H $\alpha$. Although the emission was too faint to determine accurate line profiles in regions adjacent to the nucleus, the total Br $\gamma$ emission within the central 1 kpc yields a luminosity of $1.5\times 10^{6}$ L\textsubscript{☉}, corresponding to an ionization rate of $3.2\times 10^{53}$ s\textsuperscript{-1}. This ionization rate implies a total Lyman continuum luminosity of $2.0\times 10^{9}$ L\textsubscript{☉}, which accounts for only about 1.5% of the far-infrared luminosity of NGC 1275. The derived bolometric luminosity of the ionizing source is approximately $3.8\times 10^{10}$ L\textsubscript{☉}, which is roughly 25% of the far-infrared luminosity, suggesting that the observed emission is more consistent with an AGN than a star-forming region.

The emission of [Fe ii] at 1.644 μm from NGC 1275 is exceptionally strong and concentrated at the center, accompanied by other notable iron lines in the H and K bands, including [Fe ii] 1.534 μm, [Fe iii] 2.2178 μm, and [Fe iii] 2.2420 μm. The flux of [Fe ii] 1.644 μm is comparable to that of [Fe ii] 1.257 μm, as reported by Rudy et al. Notably, the [Fe ii] emission in NGC 1275 surpasses that of other starburst and Seyfert galaxies, with a [Fe ii]/Brγ ratio of 6.3 in the central 1 kpc, significantly higher than in similar regions of NGC 3256, NGC 4945, and NGC 1068. This discrepancy suggests that iron depletion in NGC 1275 may be less severe, potentially due to an intense ambient radiation field that evaporates iron from dust grains or a cool ionizing source that produces low-ionization radiation. Alternatively, fast J-shocks and X-ray heating could also contribute to the strong [Fe ii] emission, creating reservoirs of partially ionized gas within molecular clouds.

4 Spectra

Our analysis of the continuum spectrum considered the relative contributions of stars, the active galactic nucleus, hot dust in the circumnuclear environment, and free-free emission. The K and M stars, which dominate the K-band stellar emission, exhibit strong CO absorption features in their blackbody-like spectra, allowing us to constrain the stellar contribution to the total light. In contrast, the near-infrared spectra of active galactic nuclei are characterized by a power-law spectrum with a slope ranging from -0.5 to -1.5. Hot dust, primarily resulting from reprocessed radiation from the active galactic nucleus and, to a lesser extent, starburst activity, is modeled as a blackbody spectrum with a power-law emissivity. By combining these components and accounting for extinction effects, we generated a synthetic galaxy spectrum, which was then fitted to the observed continuum spectrum using a least-squares method, with details of the procedure and constraints on the parameters discussed in the appendix and results presented in Section 3.2.

4.1 Continuum Fitting & CO Absorption

In evaluating the congruence between the synthetic spectrum, $I_{\lambda}^{\textup{SYN}}$, and the observed spectral data, $I_{\lambda}^{\textup{OBS}}$, it is essential to exclude emission lines that arise from non-continuum sources, such as shocked interstellar medium gas and photoionized gas clouds, which can introduce discrepancies. To quantify the degree of agreement between the two spectra, a goodness of fit parameter, $\chi^{2}$, is defined, taking into account the variance between the synthetic and observed intensities at each wavelength, weighted by the local noise, $\sigma_{\lambda}$. This is mathematically expressed as the normalized sum of the squared differences between $I_{\lambda}^{\textup{SYN}}$ and $I_{\lambda}^{\textup{OBS}}$, for all spectral points unaffected by line emission or absorption from non-continuum sources, which is given by the formula $\chi^{2}=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{\lambda\neq line}\frac{(I_{\lambda}^{\textup{SYN}}-I_{\lambda}^{\textup{OBS}})^{2}}{\sigma_{\lambda}^{2}}$, where $N$ represents the total number of such points.

The near-infrared flux emanating from the integrated populations of virtually all galaxies is predominantly attributed to giant stars, with supergiants playing a secondary role, as evidenced by the research conducted by Oliva et al. K5 V stars, on the other hand, are deemed insignificant contributors to the overall flux in the H and K bands, owing to their relatively faint nature across a wide range of stellar populations. In light of this, K5 III stars are selected as the underlying stellar population, given their dominance in the H and K band luminosity of most galaxies, a phenomenon observed by Frogel et al. and Oliva et al. This preeminence can be attributed to the effective temperature of approximately 4000 K, which corresponds to a blackbody emission peak within these bands, as well as their substantially greater luminosity, typically 200 times that of K5 V stars with analogous effective temperatures. Furthermore, the availability of digitized libraries of near-infrared stellar spectra in the K band, such as the one utilized in this study, enables the selection of a suitable template, in this case, the spectrum of the K5 III star γ Dra, denoted as I ${}_{\lambda}^{\textup{STAR}}$, to serve as a representative model in the K band.

The Galactic extinction towards NGC 1275 has been estimated as A ${}_{\textup{B}}$ = 0.7, equivalent to A ${}_{\textup{V}}$ = 0.53, with an additional intrinsic extinction component within the galaxy itself. Ultraviolet measurements indicate E(B-V) values ranging from 0.2 to 0.3, suggesting a nuclear extinction of approximately A ${}_{\textup{V}}$ = 1.0. However, integrated H-K colors in the central stellar region are 0.15 magnitudes redder than typical elliptical galaxies, implying a higher extinction of A ${}_{\textup{V}}$ ≈ 2.4. To reconcile these estimates, we constrain the V-band extinction to be less than 2.0, or A ${}_{\textup{K}}$ < 0.2. Given the dominant contribution of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the central light, we adopt a screen model of extinction for the central region, while utilizing a mixed stars/gas model at larger distances exceeding 500 pc.

The CO spectroscopic index of the underlying stellar population can be diminished by continuum emission from non-stellar sources, with the degree of dilution dependent on the relative strength of the non-stellar continuum. According to our modeling, the non-stellar continuum dominates the emission in the central region, contributing over 90% of the total emission and reducing the observed CO index from its intrinsic value of approximately 0.3 to approximately 0.03, thereby creating the observed CO index deficit at the nucleus of NGC 1275. This finding suggests that the nuclear stellar cluster may have a higher intrinsic CO index than initially assumed, potentially indicating a dominant population of K supergiants rather than giants, although this revision does not significantly impact the overall results due to the similar temperatures of these stellar types.

4.2 H \textsubscript{2} Excitation

The data distribution in Figure 8 reveals that the H2 gas is approximately isothermal, with an excitation temperature of around 1500 K below 8000 K and a relatively narrow range of 2600-2900 K above 8000 K. The temperature measurements remain consistent with the reported 1σ errors even without extinction correction. Notably, the data points up to level energies of approximately 20000 K align along a slightly curved line, suggesting that rotational and vibrational temperatures are comparable and fluorescent excitation is minimal. The observed excitation of the hot H2 gas, with temperatures up to 2700 K, can be attributed to collisional excitation in a post-shock environment, a mechanism commonly observed in galactic sources. However, the possibility of a photo-dissociation region (PDR) scenario cannot be entirely ruled out, particularly in dense regions such as the central 300 pc of NGC 1275, where the vibrational ladder may be thermalized while the rotational ladder remains out of equilibrium. The absence of gas temperatures above 5000 K may indicate that non-thermal processes, such as UV pumping, contribute moderately to H2 excitation.

A more detailed examination of the excitation conditions in NGC 1275 can be achieved by analyzing the ratio of ortho and para lines, thereby mitigating the uncertainty associated with the intrinsic ortho-para ratio of the gas clouds. By plotting these ratios in an ortho-para line ratio plane, it is possible to discern the relative contributions of X-ray heating, shocks, and UV pumping excitation of H₂ gas in starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN) galaxies. The ratios of specific ortho transitions, such as Rₒ = H₂ 2–1 S(1)/H₂ 1–0 S(1) and Rₚ = H₂ 1–0 S(2)/H₂ 1–0 S(0), provide a measure of the balance between thermal and non-thermal processes, with expected values ranging from 0.56 for pure non-thermal excitation to near 0 for thermal UV excitation. The calculated ratios for NGC 1275, Rₒ = 0.19 and Rₚ = 1.4, position the galaxy near NGC 6240 in the Rₒ – Rₚ plane, and an additional ratio, Rₒ = H₂ 1–0 S(3)/H₂ 1–0 S(1), further supports the classification of NGC 1275 as a powerful AGN, similar to NGC 1068.

In a state of thermal equilibrium, the ratios of emission lines are determined by the population of atoms in each quantum state and their spontaneous emission coefficients, assuming the H2 gas is optically thin, which is supported by the data in Table 3. The calculated column densities are consistently below 9.6 × 10^15 cm^-2, and the total column density of hot H2 is approximately 3 × 10^16 cm^-2. Under the assumption of a uniform distribution within the emission region, the estimated total mass of the contributing H2 gas is roughly 1000 solar masses.

The analysis of these diagrams reveals that the excitation is predominantly thermal in nature, with a minor nonthermal emission component, indicating a dense gas environment with an electron density exceeding 10^5 cm^-3. The proximity of NGC 1275 to other powerful active galactic nuclei and merger galaxies suggests that both X-ray and shock-driven mechanisms may contribute to the intense H2 emission. Our findings propose the existence of two distinct excitation sources for H2: the active galactic nucleus, which is responsible for the majority of the radiation and corresponds to the compact emission core, and a region of moderate star formation that excites the extended, faint H2 envelope.

4.2.1 UV Fluorescence

A theoretical model developed by Hollenbach and Maloney predicts the detailed line ratios resulting from excitation by a central active galactic nucleus (AGN). According to this model, the X-ray energy absorbed by a cloud at a distance of 100r pc is approximately 7 × 10^(-22) L_44 r_100^(-2) N_22^(-1) erg s^(-1), where L_44 represents the AGN luminosity and N_22 is the total column density. The heating rate is roughly 0.3-0.4 times the X-ray energy absorbed, and cooling occurs primarily through line emission from various species, including H2 1-0 S(1) and [Fe II] 1.64 μm lines. By applying our measured values, including a molecular abundance of H/H2 ∼ 10^5 and LX ≈ 2 × 10^43 erg s^(-1), to the Hollenbach and Maloney model, we can account for the observed [Fe II] to H2 1-0 S(1) line ratio. The predicted ratio of approximately 1:1 for radii larger than our beam size is consistent with our measured value of 1.5:1, considering the presumed depletion of Fe. These findings suggest that the [Fe II] emission and the [Fe II]/H2 1-0 S(1) ratio can be attributed to an X-radiation field characteristic of AGN activity.

A possible hiding place for the purported inflow of matter is in stars with an unusual distribution of masses, where the formation of low-mass stars dominates, making it difficult to estimate the total mass involved in star formation based on the number of ionizing photons emitted by massive stars. Such a population of low-mass stars would likely have a distinct spectral signature, characterized by a lower CO index due to the absence of luminous giant and supergiant stars that contribute strongly to CO absorption lines. By analyzing the stellar population in the vicinity of the galaxy's nucleus using near-infrared spectroscopy, researchers found a CO index of 0.17, which can be compared to theoretical models of low-mass star populations. These models predict a CO index between 0.07 and 0.16 for certain rates of mass deposition, and while the observed value is at the upper limit of these predictions, it cannot entirely rule out the presence of a low-mass star population, particularly if the mass deposition rate is around 200 solar masses per year, as proposed for the galaxy NGC 1275.

The radiative emission exhibited by hot H₂ can be reconciled with a predominant thermal excitation mechanism, such as that occurring in a post-shock regime, complemented by a subsidiary contribution from X-ray irradiation. Consequently, the observed line emission of molecular hydrogen in NGC 1275 can be adequately accounted for without necessitating the invocation of a "cooling flow" paradigm.

4.2.2 X-ray Excitation

Theoretical models, as formulated by Hollenbach and Maloney, predict the detailed line ratios arising from excitation by a central active galactic nucleus (AGN). According to their framework, the X-ray energy absorbed per unit time by a hydrogen nucleus in a cloud situated at a distance of 100r_{100} pc is approximately 7 \times 10^{-22} L_{44} r_{100}^{-2} N_{22}^{-1} erg s^{-1}, where L_{44} represents the AGN luminosity in units of 10^{44} erg s^{-1} and N_{22} denotes the total column density in units of 10^{22} cm^{-2}. The heating rate is roughly 0.3-0.4 times the X-ray energy absorbed, while cooling occurs primarily through line emission from various species, with the H_{2} 1-0 S(1) and [Fe ii] 1.64 \mu m lines being of particular diagnostic interest. By utilizing our derived value of N_{H_{2}^{hot}} = 3 \times 10^{16} cm^{-2}, a molecular abundance ratio of H/H_{2} \approx 10^{5}, and an X-ray luminosity of L_{X} \approx 2 \times 10^{43} erg s^{-1} (as reported by Prieto), and integrating the Hollenbach and Maloney results over our 300 pc resolution beam, we can reconcile the observed [Fe ii] to H_{2} 1-0 S(1) line ratio. For radial distances exceeding our beam size, the predicted ratio approaches 1:1, which is consistent with our measured value of 1.5:1 within a 3" aperture, considering that the predicted ratio is sensitive to the depletion of iron, known to be \lesssim 10, whereas the model assumes a value of approximately 30 (Hollenbach, private communication). Therefore, we conclude that both the [Fe ii] emission and the [Fe ii]/H_{2} 1-0 S(1) ratio can be attributed to an X-radiation field characteristic of AGN activity.

For the SW nucleus, where the AGN is assumed to dominate the X-ray luminosity, we can establish a comfortable upper limit on the extrapolated 1–100 keV luminosity. By normalising a power-law model to the 0.1–2 keV region and the entire HRI count rate, we derive an upper limit of $L\sim 12\times 10^{41}$ erg s\textsuperscript{-1}. However, the observed 1-0 S(1) luminosity in a 5\textsuperscript{′′} aperture around the SW nucleus exceeds the predicted value for X-ray excitation alone by about two orders of magnitude, based on models by Krolik & Lepp (1989) which suggest $L_{\rm 1-0\,S(1)}\sim 10^{-4}L_{\rm X-ray}$ for Seyfert 1s and $L_{\rm 1-0\,S(1)}\sim 10^{-5}L_{\rm X-ray}$ for Seyfert 2s. Furthermore, the $\sim$ 500 pc offset between the peak H\textsubscript{2} and AGN positions provides additional evidence against significant X-ray excitation.

The hydrogen emission emanating from NGC 1275 exhibits an extraordinary luminosity, surpassing that of other galaxies renowned for their intense H₂ emission, as noted by Fischer et al. The stimulation of molecular hydrogen in active galactic nuclei is generally attributed to a synergistic combination of factors, including shockwaves, ultraviolet photons, and X-ray radiation, as proposed by various researchers, such as Brand et al., Sternberg & Dalgarno, and Draine & Woods. These shockwaves can be triggered by cataclysmic events like galaxy mergers or supernovae explosions, while the ultraviolet radiation may originate from clusters of hot, massive stars, as suggested by Puxley et al. Notably, the copious X-ray emission required to excite the observed H₂ in Seyfert nuclei can only be produced by an active galactic nucleus harboring a supermassive black hole, underscoring the unique role of these cosmic entities in powering such phenomena.

4.2.3 Shock Excitation

The characteristics of the line emission imply a multifaceted excitation process, with contributions from both the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and shock-induced mechanisms. Notably, the exceptionally strong [Fe II] lines in the J band, even by AGN standards, necessitate a significant enhancement of H₂ emission to maintain a [Fe II]/H₂ 1–0 S(1) ratio approaching unity, a phenomenon observed in NGC 1275, which exhibits unusually intense H₂ emission compared to other Seyfert galaxies. The spatially extended H₂ emission, as discussed in Section 4.1, suggests that shock-driven processes, potentially resulting from a recent or ongoing merger event, may be responsible. This scenario is corroborated by the presence of an isophotal shell structure, as reported by Hernquist and Weil, and the extinction analysis conducted by Norgaard-Nielsen et al., which indicates that the high-velocity (HV) system is interacting with the main galaxy. The confluence of the HV and low-velocity (LV) systems could generate the shocks necessary to boost H₂ emission, a process analogous to that proposed for the merging galaxy NGC 6240 by van der Werf et al. While strong [Fe II] emission is not unique to NGC 1275, being observed in numerous AGNs, including IRAS luminous and starburst galaxies such as MRK 231, MRK 507, and PHL 1092, the elevated [Fe II] emission in these cases is often attributed to intense star formation in metal-rich environments, as suggested by Fillipenko and Terlevich, and Lipari et al. In contrast, the unusually high [Fe II] emission observed in NGC 1275 may be attributed to the dissociation of iron from interstellar grains via shock heating, resulting in an iron-rich gas phase, as discussed in Section 6.1.1, which would, in turn, give rise to the exceptionally strong [Fe II] emission.

Fast J shocks, with velocities of 100-300 km s⁻¹, would dissociate molecules, which then re-form downstream on grain surfaces via formation pumping, producing a spectrum similar to UV fluorescence as the molecules decay radiatively. The emissivity of 1-0 S(1) is estimated to be ∼0.02, requiring the shock to pass through 1500 M⊙ yr⁻¹ near each nucleus if 50-70% of the fluorescent emission is due to fast J shocks. However, this process is still speculative and requires additional testing to confirm or rule out. Alternatively, slow J shocks could be possible without dissociating molecules, but they would likely revert to C-type shocks under normal conditions. Fast C shocks with velocities of ∼40 km s⁻¹ could heat the gas to ≥2000 K and produce strong H₂ line emission, potentially accounting for the bulk of the thermal excitation. Estimates suggest that 1600 and 1000 M⊙ of hot gas are needed near the NE and SW nuclei, with 10 and 16 M⊙ yr⁻¹ of gas required to sustain the line's thermal luminosity. In contrast, slow C shocks are unlikely due to their low peak temperatures, resulting in very weak H₂ emission that contradicts the strong observed emission and derived temperatures.

The galaxy NGC 1275 features a highly luminous, compact X-ray emitting core, with an X-ray luminosity of approximately 2 x 10^43 erg s^-1, surrounded by a diffuse halo of intracluster gas that extends over a large scale. Notably, the nucleus is offset from the center of the cluster gas halo by around 25 arcseconds, which may be attributed to the galaxy's motion through the intracluster medium. The temperature profiles of the X-ray halo indicate a cooling flow of approximately 200 solar masses per year, where gas condenses from the surrounding medium onto the galaxy. Although the ultimate fate of this inflowing material remains uncertain, spectroscopic observations suggest that a limited fraction, no more than 10%, can form stars following a standard initial mass function, yet NGC 1275 is distinguished by evidence of ongoing star formation, setting it apart from other cooling flow galaxies.

4.3 Spatial Analysis

The H2 line emission is predominantly attributed to a compact, unresolved source located at the nucleus, accompanied by faint, extended emission spanning a few arcseconds to the west. Notably, the primary excitation source is confined to a relatively small scale of less than 300 pc, indicating that the majority of H2 emission is linked to the circumnuclear region and likely the active galactic nucleus, rather than the previously suggested cooling flow. The extended emission is characterized by a low flux level, reaching approximately 2% of the peak value at a distance of 5″ or 3.5 kpc. The total H and K band H2 emission is measured at 1.3 × 10^-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2, corresponding to a luminosity of 8 × 10^40 erg s^-1 at a distance of 70 Mpc.

The lower row of the figure reveals a more intriguing trend: the ratios of 1-0 S(1) to both Br $\gamma$ and the continuum increase with distance from the nuclei. This suggests that while H \textsubscript{2} emission near the nuclei may be linked to Br $\gamma$ and the 2 $\mu$ m continuum, possibly through star formation processes, this connection is lost at distances greater than $\sim$ 1″. Notably, the ratios remain elevated even at distances of 2–3″, corresponding to physical distances of 1–1.5 kpc, despite the very low surface brightness at these locations.

4.4 Extinction

The extinctions derived from the H $\alpha$ /H $\beta$ and H $\alpha$ /Br $\gamma$ ratios, as reported in Veilleux et al. (1995), yield relatively small values (A $\lesssim$ 3, Table 1). For the NE nucleus, the extinctions obtained from both ratios are nearly identical, suggesting an accurate measurement of the total extinction. In contrast, the SW nucleus exhibits a significantly larger A $\textsubscript{V}$ when using the Br $\gamma$ line, indicating that this less-absorbed near-infrared line probes greater optical depths. Furthermore, continuum fits to the spectra result in A $\textsubscript{V} \sim 4$, which is remarkably consistent, particularly in the K-band where A $\textsubscript{K} = 0.1$A $\textsubscript{V}$, considering the different methods used and the fact that they probe the stellar continuum rather than the excited gas. However, the Pa $\alpha$ /Br $\gamma$ ratio yields higher A $\textsubscript{V}$ values of $\sim 7$ for the NE and $\sim 13$ for the SW nuclei, which we disregard due to the low atmospheric transmission ($<$ 40%) of the Pa $\alpha$ lines and the potential for systematic errors of 10-30% to bring them in line with the other estimates.

5 Discussion

A longstanding debate in astrophysics revolves around the concept of "cooling flows," where cool gas from a galaxy's halo flows inward, driven by a dramatic temperature drop at its center. This phenomenon is observed in certain galaxies surrounded by hot, X-ray emitting gas, which exhibits a significant decrease in temperature towards the core. As the gas cools, its density increases, causing it to sink towards the galaxy's center. Estimates suggest that this process could result in substantial amounts of gas accumulating over time, such as in the case of NGC 1275, where approximately 200 solar masses of gas are predicted to fall in every year. However, despite expectations, extensive searches have failed to detect these massive gas influxes in any form, raising questions about their existence. Notably, if such large quantities of gas were indeed flowing in, they should be triggering intense star formation, far exceeding that seen in notorious starburst galaxies like M82, yet no such activity is observed, casting doubt on the validity of cooling flows.

5.1 North East Nucleus

The NE nucleus is classified from its optical spectrum as a LINER by Osterbrock & Dahari (1983) and as a Seyfert 2 by Veilleux et al. (1995). Some confusion is unavoidable as explanations for LINER spectra are typically either weak AGN or shock excitation, maybe due to a starburst (Filippenko 1996). Both we (at 2 $\mu$ m) and MGAH (at 2–20 cm) have found that this nucleus is resolved on scales of several hundred parsecs, making an AGN an unlikely proposition. Additionally, Smith et al. (1998) found evidence for simple structure at VLBI 18 cm scales. The flux they detected was 4.5 mJy, only 20% of that in the entire nucleus, suggesting that even if there is an AGN component, it certainly cannot dominate the power output. Instead we assume that all the Br $\gamma$ is due to recent star formation, and using models of Leitherer et al. (1995) we estimate the supernova rate ( $\nu_{\rm SN}$ ), K-band luminosity ( $L_{\rm K}$ ), and bolometric luminosity ( $L_{\rm bol}$ ) with which it is likely to be associated. We employ models with solar metallicity and a Salpeter (slope 2.35) initial mass function (IMF) in the range 1–100 M \textsubscript{⊙} .

The observed extension of Br $\gamma$ emission implies the presence of young stellar populations and recent star formation activity over an extended region. A slight extension of the continuum, if confirmed, may indicate enhanced star formation along the jets, potentially triggered by shock interactions with the surrounding interstellar medium. However, it is possible that some of the Br $\gamma$ emission associated with the radio jet is attributable to nuclear radiation rather than star formation. Meanwhile, the extended component of hot molecular hydrogen is likely to be shock-excited, resulting from the ongoing star formation processes.

Using the Salpeter initial mass function, which describes the distribution of stellar masses, we can calculate the proportion of stars within a specific mass range that will eventually become K5 III stars. For a population of stars with masses between 0.1 and 100 solar masses, approximately 7% of the total mass is comprised of stars with masses between 1.0 and 1.5 solar masses, which will evolve into K5 III stars. This calculation yields a total stellar mass of approximately 7.1 million solar masses within the central kiloparsec. Notably, if the population is instead dominated by K supergiants, which have masses between 12 and 14 solar masses, the estimated total stellar mass remains remarkably consistent, suggesting a robust result regardless of the specific stellar population composition.

The parameters for these two models are summarised in Table 3 as Models 1 and 2 respectively, and are compared with observed quantities. For these we used the K-band luminosity from this paper and, as above, suppose that somewhere in the range 25–70% of that in 2″ comes from the starburst. The bolometric luminosity is the infrared (8–1000 $\mu$ m) luminosity taken from Sanders et al. (1991). We assume that each nucleus contributes in rough proportion to its Br $\gamma$ and X-ray fluxes, amounting to 30–50% for the NE nucleus. The model predictions for these two quantities are factors of 3–4 less than those observed.

The supernova rate $\nu_{\rm SN}$ has an even larger discrepancy. To estimate it from the 20 cm continuum we used the relation derived by Condon & Yin (1990), between non-thermal radio continuum and supernova rate. By considering independent estimates of these for the Galaxy they found: 
 
 $L_{\rm NT}{\rm[W\,Hz^{-1}]}\ \sim\ 1.3\times 10^{23}\ (\nu{\rm[GHz]})^{-0.8}\ \nu_{\rm SN}{\rm[yr^{-1}]}$ 
 This is very similar to the relation derived for M 82 by Huang et al. (1994), who find a coefficient of $1.1\pm 0.5\times 10^{23}$ for that galaxy by considering the cumulative number of sources as a function of increasing diameter. Additionally, by using the temporal behaviour of the bright SN1979c in M 100 as a template, Colina & Pérez-Olea (1992) derived a coefficient of $0.9\times 10^{23}$ for the same equation. So this relation appears to be quite robust, whether applied to the Galaxy or to the rather different environment of starbursts. From the 20 cm radio continuum (MGAH) which has a spectral index of 0.6 and hence will be dominated by the non-thermal component at this wavelength, we derive $\nu_{\rm SN}=0.45$ yr \textsuperscript{-1} .

The free-free continuum can be estimated from the Br $\gamma$ line flux by applying case B recombination theory and assuming a temperature of 10,000 K, a method validated by previous studies as yielding consistent results with near-infrared multicolor continuum decomposition and radio measurements. Using this approach, the free-free contribution is found to be approximately 2% of the underlying continuum, although some studies suggest it could be higher in NGC 1275 due to the replenishment of free electrons from the cooling flow gas. However, a substantial population of such ions would contribute to scattering of the central source, producing a blue excess, and would require an unrealistically high X-ray/UV luminosity to explain the observed nuclear blue excess. Therefore, the free-free emission is typically set to a value of less than 3% of the total continuum, or occasionally neglected, as the fits are insensitive to its exact contribution, and its omission avoids trade-offs with the AGN emission due to their similar power-law slopes.

Research has shown that hot dust is a prevalent feature in the nuclear regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and, to a lesser extent, in starburst galaxies, where it forms a torus that absorbs and reemits radiation in the mid-infrared. The temperature of this dust is capped by the sublimation point of its constituent materials, primarily silicate and graphite grains, which occurs at approximately 1500K. The minimum radius at which dust can survive is inversely related to the luminosity of the central source, with a lower limit of around 0.2 parsecs for a source with a bolometric luminosity of $10^{46}$ erg/s. Observations of dust temperature are typically lower than the maximum temperature due to the mixing of dust at various temperatures along the line of sight, with effective temperatures often ranging from 700K to 1000K, as seen in objects like NGC 1068 and NGC 1275.

Within the central 300 parsecs, our analysis reveals that the near-infrared continuum emission is overwhelmingly driven by the active galactic nucleus and hot dust, outshining the stellar emission by a factor of at least ten. This finding is further supported by the significant dilution of continuum CO absorption lines at the nucleus, which suggests a substantial presence of non-stellar emission. The most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is the presence of a supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy, surrounded by a dense torus or disk of molecular gas, rather than intense star formation activity, as evidenced by the absence of prominent CO absorption features.

A different approach is to consider an alternative origin for the synchrotron radiation – which must nevertheless arise from electrons accelerated by shocks since we have shown that an AGN is not a proposition. Perhaps the two most important pieces of evidence are: (1) the 1-0 S(1) and radio continuum appear to be related to each other because of their shock origin, and (2) although the radio continuum is resolved, both it and the 1-0 S(1) are very compact (on scales of 0.4″) – and, crucially, more so than the 2 $\mu$ m continuum (0.7″). Our spectra show that the 2 $\mu$ m continuum is dominated by late-type stars, and presumably traces out the region of recent star formation. We argue that perhaps the radio and 1-0 S(1) are not directly associated with the star formation. Although the spatial scales are too small to make a definitive statement, the morphology does appear to be similar to that of NGC 6240 where the gas has settled between the two continuum nuclei and is radiating strong thermal 1-0 S(1) emission (van der Werf et al. 1993, Sugai et al. 1997b, Tacconi et al. 1999) . If NGC 6240 were moved away so that its nuclei, instead of being 1.5″ apart, were separated by only 0.5″, it would begin to look like Mkn 266 NE. We speculate whether Mkn 266 NE could itself consist of two or more (unresolved) continuum nuclei with gas settling between them. As the models we have considered imply, star formation has occured recently in these nuclei, but the supernova rate is very low so essentially all the radio continuum originates in the settling gas. A serious difficulty with such an interpretation is that Mkn 266 NE has a 3.6 cm intensity (scaled from the 2 cm, MGAH) of 7.0 mJy within 0.3″ $\times$ 0.4″, while NGC 6240 has diffuse 3.6 cm emission at the level of 0.2 mJy in a 0.23″ $\times$ 0.32″ beam (Colbert et al. 1994) – some 35 times fainter. Since we cannot invoke an AGN, it is hard to conceive of a method to produce so much more non-thermal radio emission without reverting to fast shocks. Bell (1978) showed that the radio emissivity of shocked gas is strongly dependent on the shock velocity $v_{\rm s}$ : 
 
 $\epsilon(\nu)\ \propto\ \left(\frac{n_{\rm e}}{\rm cm^{-3}}\right)\ \left(\frac{B}{\rm 10^{-4}\,G}\right)^{\alpha+1}\ \left(\frac{v_{\rm s}}{\rm 10^{4}\,km\,s^{-1}}\right)^{4\alpha}\ \left(1+\left[\frac{v_{\rm s}}{\rm 7000\,km\,s^{-1}}\right]^{-2}\right)^{\alpha}\ \left(\frac{\nu}{\rm GHz}\right)^{-\alpha}$ 
 So for a typical spectral index of $\alpha=0.8$ we find that $\epsilon(\nu)\propto v_{\rm s}^{1.6}$ for $v_{\rm s}\lesssim 2000$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} ; while $\epsilon(\nu)\propto v_{\rm s}^{3.2}$ for $v_{\rm s}\gtrsim 7000$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} . To produce such intense synchrotron emission requires shocks with speeds of several thousand  km s \textsuperscript{-1} , 3–10 times faster than the 300 km s \textsuperscript{-1} seen in the CO line in NGC 6240 by Tacconi et al. (1999). However, in NGC 6240 higher velocities than in the CO line were observed in 1-0 S(1) which has a FWHM of 550 km s \textsuperscript{-1} and FWZI of 1600 km s \textsuperscript{-1} (van der Werf et al. 1993). Also, in Section 4.2 we saw that the fraction of H \textsubscript{2} excited by dissociation due to fast shocks is much higher in Mkn 266 than in NGC 6240; and to account for this $\sim$ 100 times more gas in Mkn 266 is shocked at high velocities than at the low velocities expected in dense molecular clouds. Bell’s equation shows that, keeping all other parameters the same, increasing the shock velocity from 300 km s \textsuperscript{-1} to 3000 km s \textsuperscript{-1} would increase the synchrotron intensity by a factor of 30, similar to the observed difference between NGC 6240 and Mkn 266. It does not seem totally unreasonable then to extrapolate from NGC 6240 to a more extreme environment in Mkn 266 NE: if gas has settled into a disk structure on scales several times smaller than in NGC 6240, the velocities required to support it centrifugally will be many times greater and this could give rise to the fast shocks required to produce the intense synchrotron emission. High resolution observations of the CO in this nucleus will be needed to decide whether this speculation is indeed borne out.

The galaxy NGC 1275 is characterized as a Fanaroff-Riley type I radio source, exhibiting prominent radio lobes that extend approximately 10 kpc in length, oriented at a position angle of 160 degrees, and emanating from a central core. Observations suggest that the radio lobes' asymmetry and spectral indices indicate a nearly pole-on view of the central radio engine. Within the central 30″ region, the pressure generated by relativistic particles and magnetic fields from the bipolar radio lobes surpasses the thermal gas pressure, thereby disrupting any cooling flow. High-resolution VLBI imaging reveals that the central core comprises multiple smaller components and a jet pair, with a newly discovered component located 55 mas south of the central peak. Furthermore, near-infrared photometry indicates that non-stellar emission, potentially originating from hot dust or optically thin synchrotron radiation, dominates the nuclear K-band light, while recent HST observations in the UV suggest that any nuclear engine or star cluster must be smaller than 17 pc in size.

5.2 South West Nucleus

This nucleus has also been identified as a LINER (Veilleux et al. 1995) and Seyfert 2 (Osterbrock & Dahari 1983). The classification as a LINER rested solely on the ratio [O iii ]/H $\beta=1.4$ because the diagrams used to distinguish LINERs, Seyferts, and starbursts all plotted this value, against the ratios of [N ii ], [S ii ], and [O i ] to H $\alpha$ . Evidence for an AGN comes from MGAH who observed an unresolved radio core in the SW component using a beamwidth of $0.3$ ″ $\times 0.4$ ″, and our deconvolved continuum image. An additional line of reasoning put forward by Wang et al. (1997) is that photoionisation by the hard radiation field of an AGN is needed to explain both the luminosity of the large-scale optical emission line nebula as well as the line ratios. As discussed in Section 3 , based on the 2 $\mu$ m continuum we would argue for a combination of Seyfert plus starburst.

 To further investigate the nature of this object we have obtained optical and near infrared spectra. The optical spectrum shows a normal Seyfert 2 spectrum with strong narrow emission lines but no broad lines, and a blue continuum which could be either non thermal or due to young stars. The near infrared spectrum (Fig.~1) is very red and shows a strong CO bandhead at 2.3 $\mu$ m, indicative of the presence of stars. The Br $\gamma$ line is also detected, and its strength is consistent with the expected contribution from the detected Pa $\beta$ line, assuming case B recombination and a screen of dust with $A_V$ = 4 mag. The fact that the Pa $\beta$ and Br $\gamma$ lines have the same width suggests that they originate in the same region, and the lack of broad lines rules out the presence of a type 1 AGN.

More interesting is the H \textsubscript{2} , which peaks to the north east between the galaxies in a region without any associated Br $\gamma$ or continuum, and 500 pc from the nucleus. This would seem to rule out any connection with either the AGN or star formation. In Section 4.2 we showed that 70% of the 1-0 S(1) emission in this nucleus was thermally excited and deduced that it arose mostly in $\sim 40$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} C shocks. Together these suggest that it may due to shocks resulting from the interaction being driven into clouds. Both we and Veilleux et al. (1995) found a radial velocity difference between the nuclei of 50 km s \textsuperscript{-1} , setting a lower limit on the speed of the interaction. It is likely that the actual speed is faster, but shock speeds similar to that required can be produced when a high speed shock in a low density medium encounters a high density medium, the process favoured for the H \textsubscript{2} excitation in NGC 6240 by van der Werf et al. (1993) and Sugai et al. (1997b). However, it is not possible to comment here on whether it is due to the global interaction, or if it results from the gas dynamics more closely associated with the SW nucleus.

5.3 The Central Radio Continuum

The K band continuum structure of NGC 1275, unveiled in Figure 3, accurately depicts the true, line-emission-free profile, with its peak centered at the nucleus, thereby substantiating the notion that the predominant emission originates from within a compact central region spanning approximately 300 parsecs. Furthermore, a subtle extension is discernible, oriented in a south-easterly to north-westerly direction, closely aligning with the radio position angle of 160 degrees, as previously reported by Pedlar et al., and this feature exhibits a statistical significance of 2 standard deviations.

Numerous studies have cast doubt on the notion that gas accumulation occurs in the form of molecular hydrogen, citing the scarcity of CO emissions typically associated with H₂, despite the anomalous case of NGC 1275, which exhibits elevated CO levels compared to other cooling flow galaxies, as noted by researchers such as Lazareff et al., Inoue et al., and O'Dea et al. Nevertheless, the temperature conditions in this environment are markedly distinct from those found in cold molecular clouds, rendering the conventional CO-to-H₂ conversion factor potentially inapplicable, and possibly even irrelevant, due to the vastly different thermal regimes.

The concentration of hot molecular hydrogen exhibits a pronounced spatial affinity for the central nucleus of NGC 1275, with a radial extent of less than 300 parsecs. This localized distribution is at odds with the expectation that the H₂ emission would be more diffuse, given that a cooling flow scenario would necessitate the gas to traverse the entirety of the galaxy, thereby yielding a more extensive distribution. Furthermore, the relative faintness of the H₂ 2–1 S(3) line, as discussed in Section 4.3, serves to underscore the intimate connection between the hot H₂ and the galactic nucleus, suggesting a spatially coherent relationship.

We have determined that the core radius of the nuclear stellar cluster is less than 500 parsecs, and utilizing this upper limit, along with the cluster's stellar mass, allows us to estimate the anticipated velocity dispersion using the formula derived by Eckart et al. This yields a minimum expected velocity dispersion of approximately 8.4 kilometers per second, which exceeds the detection capabilities of our instrument, even if CO absorption had been observed at the nucleus.

We offer a slightly different interpretation. Wang et al. (1997) have argued that X-ray and optical emission line observations point towards a radial outflow of gas at several hundred  km s \textsuperscript{-1} which has swept up much of the ISM, and they conclude that the NE starburst and SW AGN play comparable roles in photoionising the nebula. At distances of a few kpc, the outflow velocity is $\sim 300$ km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Our hypothesis is that the radio continuum traces the interface between the expanding shock fronts from the two nuclei. When added to the relative velocity of the galaxies, the relative velocities of these shocks will be approaching 1000 km s \textsuperscript{-1} . Copious quantities of non-thermal radio emission will be produced even if the density of the shocked material is fairly low, but there will be no 1-0 S(1) and little hydrogen recombination flux as the gas is heated to $10^{6}$ – $10^{7}$ K. A test of this would be to observe the region with high spatial resolution in the 0.1–2 keV range, to see if there is a local increase in the temperature of the X-ray emitting gas over the ambient temperature in the bubble of 10 \textsuperscript{6} K.

6 H \textsubscript{2} Excitation: The Wider Perspective

Our findings suggest that the lack of observable CO bandheads in the nuclear emission spectrum can be attributed to significant contamination from both thermal dust emission and power-law continuum emission, which effectively masks their presence.

The diminished intensity of the H₂ 2-1 S(3) line can be attributed to resonant fluorescent excitation of the upper energy level, facilitated by Lyα photons, which are readily available in environments where X-ray heating excites a significant fraction of H₂ molecules. This mechanism is consistent with the dominance of X-ray heating from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the nuclear region of NGC 1275, as evidenced by the weakness of the H₂ 2-1 S(3) line. The lack of detailed models for this process presents an opportunity for NGC 1275 to serve as a test case, and identifying similar galaxies with weak H₂ 2-1 S(3) lines, such as NGC 1068, could provide valuable insights into the radiative interactions between AGN and surrounding molecular material, ultimately refining our understanding of this complex process.

We have now observed several other such systems similar to NGC 6240 by targeting close mergers, although with current observations it is not possible to say whether the gas has formed a disk structure in these galaxies. These include Mkn 551 (Sugai et al 1997a), Mkn 266 (here), and Mkn 496 (Sugai et al. 1999a). Also, the line images of NGC 3256 (Kotilainen et al 1996) suggest that there is an enhancement of 1-0 S(1) between the two nuclei with respect to both the Br $\gamma$ and [Fe ii ], which fall to a minimum. This phenomenon is not limited to the luminous infrared galaxies, and has also been observed in some blue compact dwarf galaxies (II Zw 40, NGC 5253, and He 2-10, Davies et al. (1998)) where again the 1-0 S(1) bears little or no resemblence to the Br $\gamma$ or 2 $\mu$ m continuum. However, the 1-0 S(1) surface brightness is low in these interacting systems, and it could only be detected because they are all nearby ( $<$ 10 Mpc). The more luminous galaxies with correspondingly larger gas masses do form a better sample for further study, and although such emission is not always observed (eg Arp 299, Sugai et al 1999b), it may nevertheless be a relatively common phenomenon and should be observable with the current generation of infrared instrumentation.

7 Summary & Conclusions

We have presented near infrared data on Mkn 266 consisting of 2 $\mu$ m continuum, and Br $\gamma$ and 1-0 S(1) emission line images, as well as K-band spectra. These are analysed in conjunction with data from the literature, primarily the radio continuum (MGAH).

The galaxy NGC 1275, located at the center of the Perseus cluster, has been categorized in various ways, including as an active galaxy, a merger, and a radio jet source, yet its physical properties across the electromagnetic spectrum remain poorly understood. Exhibiting characteristics of multiple source types, NGC 1275 has been classified as a Seyfert galaxy, a galaxy collision, and a BL Lac object, with some authors suggesting it may be more accurately described as a LINER. The galaxy's complex structure consists of two primary components: a dominant low-velocity component corresponding to the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1275, and a higher-velocity component that is likely a spiral galaxy positioned in front of the main galaxy.

Our analysis of the spectra reveals several key findings. By fitting stellar templates to the spectra, away from emission lines, we can remove absorption features and measure the fluxes of weak emission lines. This process also allows us to determine the origin of the continuum, which is attributed to supergiants (20-25% in the NE and 50% in the SW) and late-type giant stars. Additionally, level population diagrams of hot H₂ molecules indicate that thermal excitation dominates the 1-0 S(1) line in both nuclei, with 81% (NE) and 71% (SW) of the emission arising from temperatures of 1500 K and 2460 K, respectively, likely driven by C-shocks. Notably, pure thermal models are ruled out, suggesting that non-thermal emission, possibly from dissociative J-shocks, also contributes. Furthermore, despite the low surface brightness of the 1-0 S(1) line away from the nuclei, its ratio to Br γ and the continuum remains high, even at distances of 2-3″.

The conclusions we draw are listed below.

This study aims to refine existing models of NGC 1275 by leveraging near infrared imaging spectroscopy and spectral synthesis modeling, capitalizing on the enhanced optical depth penetration and diagnostic capabilities of NIR observations in dusty environments, which can reveal the physical properties of the gas and stellar components in the nucleus, with all distances calculated assuming a scale of 344 pc ″ \textsuperscript{-1} based on a Hubble constant of 75 km s \textsuperscript{-1} Mpc \textsuperscript{-1} and a redshift of 0.0172.

Notably, the thermal fluctuations within the hot hydrogen plasma are remarkably minimal, with the temperature exhibiting a limited range of approximately 1500 Kelvin across a substantial energy spectrum, from absolute zero to around 20000 Kelvin. In contrast, a cooling gas cloud would typically be expected to display a far more pronounced temperature gradient, suggesting that the observed data may not be entirely representative of such a scenario.

The stellar population of NGC 1275 is consistent with that of typical E/S0 galaxies, as evidenced by a CO ${}_{\textup{sp}}$ value of 0.17, which is in line with the findings of Frogel et al. Moreover, this CO ${}_{\textup{sp}}$ value corresponds to a K5 III star, as noted by Doyon et al., thereby supporting our spectral synthesis results for regions beyond approximately 3 ″.
