Curvature effects in turbulent premixed flames of H2/Air: a DNS study with reduced chemistry

By Gabriele Rocco and Francesco Battista and Francesco Picano and Guido Troiani and Carlo Massimo Casciola

Abstract

Data from a three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation of a turbulent premixed Bunsen flame with a low global Lewis number are analyzed to investigate the impact of curvature on the local flame front. The chemical kinetics are modeled using a reduced scheme with 5 reactions and 7 species to replicate a H₂/Air flame at an equivalence ratio of φ=0.5. The results show that concave flame fronts, which are elongated into the fresh gases, exhibit increased local temperatures and reaction rates, whereas convex fronts, which are elongated towards the burnt mixture, experience local quenching. Notably, the reaction region is predominantly characterized by the presence of super-reactive zones (concave fronts) and quenched zones (convex fronts), rather than behaving like the corresponding unstretched laminar flame. Specifically, the probability density function of the OH radical concentration within the reaction region displays a bi-modal shape, with peaks corresponding to negative (concave) and positive (convex) curvatures, and a locally flat front is less frequently observed. These two states are associated with higher and lower chemical activity compared to the laminar case. Further analysis of statistics conditioned on the local hydrogen concentration provides additional insights into this dual-state dynamics and the differences between the turbulent and laminar unstretched flames across the reaction region. Ultimately, the study reveals that turbulent fluctuations, which increase flame front corrugations, are primarily responsible for local flame quenching, highlighting the significant effects of turbulence on thermo-diffusive instability.

1 Introduction

The growing concern for the environment and the increasing cost of fossil fuels are prompting modern designers to explore alternative fuels for power production and transportation systems. Among the most promising options for the near future are hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuel mixtures, such as syngas, which typically contains methane, carbon monoxide, or small amounts of fossil gases. The advantages of these fuels include their low emissions, high energy density, and abundance in the natural environment.

Gaseous hydrogen has a distinctively low molecular mass compared to carbon-based fuels, resulting in a faster diffusion speed. This high mass diffusion rate significantly impacts mixing and combustion processes, leading to thermo-diffusive instabilities that can cause local flame quenching and high temperature fluctuations. The Lewis number, which is the ratio of heat to mass diffusion coefficients, is a key parameter in combustion theory that characterizes the instability of flame behavior. In mixtures with multiple species, the global Lewis number is typically assumed to be equal to the Lewis number of the least abundant species, calculated with respect to the stoichiometric balance. When the Lewis number is significantly less than one, thermo-diffusive instabilities occur, resulting in local flame quenching and the formation of regions with peaked reactions, a phenomenon well-explained in the context of laminar flames.

Chakraborty et al. (3) investigated the impact of the global Lewis number on scalar transport properties in turbulent premixed flames using a simplified chemistry approach. Their three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of statistically planar flames explored a wide range of Lewis numbers, both above and below the critical value of $Le=1$. The results showed that flames with low Lewis numbers (${\rm Le}\ll 1$) exhibited strong counter-gradient transport effects, whereas increasing the Lewis number led to gradient transport, characterized by a Fick-like law. Counter-gradient transport is defined as $J_{D}\cdot\nabla c>0$, in contrast to Fick-like transport, where $J_{D}\cdot\nabla c<0$, with $J_{D}$ representing the diffusive flux and $c$ the concentration. Although this study examined the effects of a globally defined Lewis number on flames in realistic configurations, it did not account for local effects resulting from differences in mass diffusivity among chemical species.

A similar two-dimensional configuration is employed by Chakraborty et al. (15) to examine the relationship between strain rate, curvature, and surface density function. Using Direct Numerical Simulations and a detailed chemical model, they analyze two turbulent premixed flames fueled by lean methane-air and hydrogen-air mixtures. The study compares the statistical properties of these flames and explores how thermochemistry and preferential diffusion impact the surface density function, $\sigma=\left|\nabla c\right|$, a key observable in turbulent premixed flames due to its direct correlation with the dissipation rate, $\chi=D\sigma^{2}$, which plays a critical role in turbulent combustion modeling (16).

A similar geometry is examined in (17), where direct numerical simulations (DNS) of hydrogen-air turbulent premixed flames are used to study the local flame structure and its fractal characteristics, revealing a strong dependence of flame structure on the Reynolds number, with local quenching increasing as the Reynolds number rises.

Im & Chen (18) investigated the interaction between premixed flames and two-dimensional turbulence through numerical simulations, comparing the effects of curvature and strain on lean and rich hydrogen/air premixed flames. The study revealed opposite effects on the chemical activity of the two flames. Further research (19) examined the impact of thermo-diffusive instability on a initially planar, two-dimensional hydrogen flame, using 1D and 2D simulations of a lean premixed hydrogen flame, which demonstrated that even a 2D flame can be unstable, leading to self-induced flame wrinkling and fluctuations. A more comprehensive analysis of statistically planar turbulent flames in 3D was conducted in (2), where the authors explored the behavior of lean premixed hydrogen flames and the effects of the Karlovitz number (Ka) and equivalence ratio ($\phi$) on flame instability, including the cellular flame regime. At high Karlovitz numbers, they observed the occurrence of the distributed flame regime, characterized by a broad flame front resembling a mixing region.

Wang et al. (6) investigated the impact of a swirling flame on preferential diffusion in hydrogen-air flames, finding that swirl suppresses the effects of preferential diffusion.

This study examines the impact of preferential hydrogen diffusion on a turbulent premixed Bunsen flame, with a focus on how turbulent fluctuations influence local flame dynamics. The investigation utilizes a hydrogen/air mixture generated by a companion simulation, which produces a fully developed turbulent pipe flow with realistic fluctuations at the Bunsen inlet. The chosen geometry is not only experimentally reproducible but also marks an advancement in direct numerical simulations of turbulent combustion.

In line with previous research, our findings confirm the presence of characteristic cusp-like structures on the flame front, which protrude towards the products in quenched regions and induce super-burning regions in the opposite structures. We quantitatively analyze this behavior in the turbulent regime, comparing the local turbulent flame structure to both the unstrained laminar flame and the laminar flame subject to thermo-diffusive instability. To elucidate these differences, we present joint probability distributions of key parameters, including local flame front curvature, velocity gradient, OH radical concentration, and hydrogen atomic equivalence ratio, relative to laminar cases.

The statistics are conditioned on various intervals of local hydrogen concentration, enabling a comprehensive study of the reaction region from start to finish and a direct comparison with the unstretched laminar flame. Within the local flame, the dynamics deviate significantly from those of the corresponding unstrained premixed flame, yielding two distinct burning states: a super-burning cell characterized by high chemical activity and temperatures exceeding the adiabatic value, and an almost quenched region. The local state is primarily governed by the local curvature of the flame front. A comparison with the corresponding laminar Bunsen flame reveals the impact of turbulence on front dynamics, highlighting that while the cellular structure induced by thermo-diffusive instability in the laminar flame exhibits super-burning regions similar to those in the turbulent flame, quenched regions occur much less frequently in the laminar case.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the numerical tool, chemical mechanism, and physical parameters used for the Direct Numerical Simulation of the 3D turbulent flame. Section 3 presents the results obtained from the DNS, including instantaneous and statistical analyses based on the joint probability density function. Finally, concluding remarks and comments are provided in Section 4.

2 Numerical methodology

The problem is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates, assuming a constant pressure $p_{0}$ in an open environment. To solve these equations, a low-Mach number asymptotic approximation is applied, yielding the following dimensionless governing equations:

The viscous stress tensor is given by ${\bf\Sigma}=2\,{\sigma_{\mu}(T)}\,{\bf E}{+\sigma_{\lambda}\,tr({\bf E}){\bf I}}={\sigma_{\mu}(T)}\,(\nabla\bf u+{\nabla\bf u}^{T}){+\sigma_{\lambda}\,\nabla\cdot{\bf u}\,{\bf I}}$, where $\sigma_{\lambda}$ is set to zero and $\sigma_{\mu}(T)=\mu/\mu_{0}$ represents the dimensionless, temperature-dependent viscosity. The variables $\rho$, $\bf u$, $p_{0}$, and $P$ denote the density, velocity, thermodynamic pressure, and dynamic pressure, respectively. Note that the thermodynamic pressure $p_{0}$ is constant in both space and time due to the low-Mach number expansion and open space conditions, and is assumed to be dimensionless with a value of $p_{0}=1$, corresponding to 1 atm. The concentration and global reaction rate of the $a^{th}$ species are represented by $Y_{a}$ and $\omega_{a}$, while $\sigma_{D}(T)=D_{a}/D_{a}^{0}$ and $\sigma_{T}(T)=\alpha/\alpha_{0}$ are the dimensionless mass and thermal diffusivities. The dynamic viscosity at reference conditions is denoted by $\mu_{0}$, and the Reynolds number is defined as ${\rm Re}=\rho_{0}{U_{0}L_{0}}/\mu_{0}$, where $U_{0}$ and $L_{0}$ are the typical velocity and length scales. Additionally, the Prandtl number at reference conditions is ${\rm Pr}=\mu_{0}/(\rho_{0}\alpha_{0})$, and the ratio of the constant pressure coefficient to the constant volume coefficient is $\gamma$. The Schmidt number for the $a^{th}$ species is ${\rm Sc_{a}}=\mu_{0}/(\rho_{0}{\cal D}_{a{\rm N}_{2}})$, which depends on the $a^{th}$ species and the most abundant species in the mixture (N\textsubscript{2} in this case). Further details on the values of the parameters and assumptions used in modeling the mass diffusion coefficients can be found in section 2.2.

The Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the Bunsen flame is conducted using a conservative formulation on a staggered grid, where second-order central finite differences are employed. To handle non-linear terms in scalar equations (1) and (3), Bounded Central Difference Schemes (23) are utilized. The temporal evolution is then advanced using a low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta scheme.

The inflow boundary conditions are time-dependent and are prescribed using a fully turbulent velocity profile, which is dynamically assigned from a companion simulation of a fully developed pipe flow. This simulation provides a realistic turbulent inlet condition by extracting the velocity profile at each time step and applying it to the inlet surface of the jet. The computational domain is a cylinder, where flow is injected through an orifice in one base and exits at the other end. The orifice has a uniform density and species concentration profile. A convective Orlanski condition is applied at the outflow section, while the lateral surface of the cylinder is modeled with an adiabatic traction-free condition, allowing for the entrainment of external fluid, as illustrated in figure 1 panel (a).

The numerical integration begins with known fields at a generic time step $n$, including density $\rho^{n}$, momentum $(\rho{\bf u})^{n}$, and species mass fraction $(\rho Y_{a})^{n}$. Notably, for the low-Mach number expansion and open environment configuration considered here, the thermodynamic pressure remains constant in both space and time. As a result, given the density $\rho^{n}$, the temperature $T^{n}$ can be determined using the equation of state, eq. (5). The key steps of the solution algorithm are outlined as follows:

The mass conservation equation is utilized to compute the fluid density at the subsequent time step, denoted as $\rho^{n+1}$, by integrating the relevant quantities.

The momentum equation, with the hydrodynamic pressure term omitted, is utilized to determine the unprojected velocity field, denoted as $(\rho\bf v)^{n+1}$.

The species continuity equation is used to advance $(\rho Y_{a})^{n+1}$ in time, where the source terms in the species equations depend solely on temperature, pressure, and species mass fractions from the previous time step $n$.

The velocity is then projected to enforce the local divergence value, which is dependent on the diffusive temperature flux and combustion heat release. This projection method is a straightforward extension of Chorin's classical method, commonly used for integrating fully incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The process involves solving a linear system, which is accomplished using the SuperLU Library (27).

The numerical code has undergone extensive testing across a range of configurations, including cold incompressible jets (see, for example, reference 25) and reactive premixed Bunsen flames (see, for example, reference 30).

The chemical kinetics model significantly impacts the dynamics of the flame, but global chemistry schemes, although useful for incorporating complex chemical features into turbulent simulations, are limited by their inability to account for intermediate radicals, making them unsuitable for studying instabilities and extinction phenomena. To address this, a reduced mechanism derived from the original GRI-mech 2.1 mechanism is utilized, consisting of a 5-step process that includes four key radicals (H, O, OH, NO) in addition to the primary reactants (H₂, O₂, H₂O, N₂), as described in detail elsewhere.

H+O $\rightleftharpoons$ OH

H+O ${}_{2}\rightleftharpoons$ OH+O

H \textsubscript{2} +OH $\rightleftharpoons$ H \textsubscript{2} O+H

H \textsubscript{2} +O $\rightleftharpoons$ H+OH

N \textsubscript{2} +O ${}_{2}\rightleftharpoons$ 2 NO.

The GRI-mech scheme is a comprehensive chemical kinetics mechanism that incorporates recent literature results and has been validated over a wide range of physical conditions, including temperatures between 1000 and 2500 K, pressures from 10 Torr to 10 atm, and equivalence ratios from 0.1 to 5 for premixed systems. A key advantage of this scheme is its optimized chemical kinetics, which accounts for the effects of a large number of elementary reactions on target species through quasi-steady state and local equilibrium assumptions. Although the quasi-steady state assumption for H₂O₂ and HO₂ kinetics may introduce inaccuracies at moderate temperatures and high pressures, this effect is not significant for the present work, which focuses on statistically steady states at pressures of 1 atm and temperatures between 300 and 1550 K. The GRI-mech scheme also includes helium, but it is neglected in the present simulations as its role is primarily related to pollutant generation, which is outside the scope of this paper. The formation enthalpies of species, Δhₐ⁰, are taken from the NASA-Lewis and Technion archives and are used to compute the heat release, ωₚ = -∑[Δhₐ⁰ \* ω̇ₐ], where Nₛ is the number of species and ω̇ₐ is the global production rate of each species.

Binary mass diffusion coefficients $\mathcal{D}_{jk}$, which describe the diffusion of species $j$ into species $k$, can significantly influence flame structure and the formation of thermo-diffusive instabilities. However, calculating these coefficients exactly is computationally expensive, as it involves solving an $N_{s}\times N_{s}$ linear system at each grid point and time step, making it a significant limitation for approaches like Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) that require a large number of grid points and small time steps. A more viable approach is to use Fick's diffusion, motivated here by the Hirschfelder and Curtiss approximation. This involves using an equivalent diffusion coefficient $D_{a}$ for a single species into the rest of the mixture, given by $D_{a}=\frac{1-Y_{a}}{\sum_{j\neq a}X_{j}/\mathcal{D}_{aj}}$, where $X_{j}$ is the mole fraction of species $j$. Due to the abundance of nitrogen in air, $D_{a}$ can be approximated as the binary diffusivity of species $j$ into nitrogen, $D_{a}\simeq\mathcal{D}_{a{\rm N_{2}}}$. The binary diffusion coefficients $\mathcal{D}_{a{\rm N_{2}}}$ can be evaluated assuming binary collisions, which is valid for sufficiently diluted gases where ternary and higher-order collisions are negligible. While this simplification reduces computational complexity, it introduces small errors near the flame front. The temperature dependence of the diffusivity is preserved by fixing the Schmidt number, ${\rm Sc}_{a}=\mu_{0}/(\rho_{0}\mathcal{D}_{a{\rm N}_{2}})$, such that the mass diffusivities and thermal diffusivity inherit the temperature dependence of the dynamic viscosity, $\sigma_{\mu}(T)=\sigma_{a}(T)=\sigma_{T}(T)=(T/T_{0})^{0.5}$, following a Sutherland-like law, with the proportionality fixed by evaluating the diffusion coefficients at $298\,K$.

Given the excess of N\textsubscript{2} and the involved temperature range, with a burnt-to-unburnt gas temperature ratio of $T_{b}/T_{u}\simeq 5$, the dependence of $\gamma$ on the mixture composition can be safely neglected, and a constant value of $\gamma=1.25$ can be considered a reasonable approximation (13).

Representative computational results for a one-dimensional, planar, and stationary flame at an equivalence ratio of $\phi=0.5$ are presented in figure 2, with simulation parameters matching those of the fully 3D simulations to be discussed in the following section. The calculated adiabatic flame temperature ($T_{ad}\simeq 1555\,K$) and flame speed ($S_{L}=0.35\,m/s$) are consistent with literature values, such as those reported in (14). The top panel of figure 2 shows the mass fractions as a function of the streamwise coordinate, indicating that at this equivalence ratio, hydrogen is completely consumed, while approximately $48\%$ of $O_{2}$ remains unreacted. The reaction zone, where radical concentrations are highest, spans the region from $x=0.002\,m$ to $x=0.0035\,m$. The concentration of the OH radical can be used as an indicator of the reaction progress, as seen in experimental measurements of H\textsubscript{2}-lean flames (33). This is confirmed by the bottom panel of figure 2, which plots the OH mass fraction ($Y_{\rm OH}$) against the H\textsubscript{2} mass fraction ($Y_{\rm H_{2}}$), illustrating a relationship valid for one-dimensional laminar planar flames, here referred to as $Y_{\rm OH}=Y_{\rm OH}^{L}(Y_{{\rm H}_{2}})$. As the reaction progresses and H\textsubscript{2} is consumed, the OH mass fraction increases sharply, peaking at $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}=2\times 10^{-4}$ when the fuel is nearly depleted, and then decreases more gradually due to slow recombination phenomena.

We have provided a detailed description of the one-dimensional laminar flame because it serves as a reference for evaluating local turbulent fluctuations of OH mass fraction $Y_{OH}(\mathbf{x},t)$ in the turbulent flame. To measure local combustion activity, we use a statistical sampling of OH and ${\rm H}_{2}$ concentrations in the turbulent flame. For a given turbulent event with $OH$ and $H_{2}$ concentrations of $Y_{\rm OH}^{T}$ and $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}^{T}$, respectively, we associate a corresponding laminar state $Y^{L}_{\rm OH}(Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}^{T})$, which is derived from the $OH$ concentration profile in the laminar flame, defined by the function $Y_{\rm OH}=Y^{L}_{\rm OH}(Y_{{\rm H}_{2}})$ (as shown in the bottom panel of figure 2).

A positive or negative deviation in the flamelet mass fraction, denoted as $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}=Y_{\rm OH}-Y^{L}_{\rm OH}|_{Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}}$, indicates an increase or decrease in chemical activity relative to the corresponding laminar state. This observable is useful for highlighting the differences between the local turbulent flame and its corresponding laminar unstretched flame. Specifically, it does so by quantifying the deviation of local turbulent quantities from their laminar counterparts at the same hydrogen concentration, $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$.

The DNS parameters are chosen to replicate a laboratory-scale premixed Bunsen flame of a lean H₂-Air mixture. The fuel issues from a pipe with a radius of $R=0.009\,\rm m$, a bulk velocity of $U_{0}=5\,\rm m/s$, and an equivalence ratio of $\phi=0.5$. The surrounding environment is filled with pure air at the same temperature as the fresh gas, $T=298K$. The Reynolds number is ${\rm Re}_{R}=3000$, the Prandtl number is ${\rm Pr}=0.6$, and the Froude number, accounting for buoyancy effects, is $Fr=16.8$. The Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers at the inflow are $Da\simeq 22.3$ and $Ka\simeq 0.65$, respectively. The computational domain, spanning $2\pi\times 12R\times 14R$, is discretized using a $128\times 201\times 560$ mesh with radial stretching to capture the shear layers and flame front dynamics. The grid spacing near the nozzle exit is $\Delta\simeq 2\eta_{k}$, where $\eta_{k}$ is the Kolmogorov length scale near the pipe wall, ensuring at least four grid points across the instantaneous flame front. Further details and comparisons with experimental data can be found in reference (30), which uses an identical numerical setup to simulate a Bunsen premixed flame with a global reaction model.

Two 3D simulations were performed and analyzed: one reproducing a turbulent Bunsen flame with a turbulent inflow velocity, and the other reproducing a laminar Bunsen flame with a parabolic velocity profile at the jet inlet. To isolate the effects of turbulent fluctuations, all other parameters were held constant across both simulations. The turbulent flame simulation was run for approximately 4.5 $R/U_{0}$ time scales in the statistical steady state, during which 60 uncorrelated fields were collected at intervals of 0.075 $R/U_{0}$ to enable statistical analysis.

2.1 Flow solver

The Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates describe the problem in an open environment with a constant pressure $p_{0}$. To simplify the governing equations, a low-Mach number asymptotic approximation is applied, yielding the following dimensionless equations:

The governing equations for the system are given by the continuity equation (1), the momentum equation (2), the species transport equation (3), and the energy equation (4): 
$\displaystyle\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho{\bf u})=0$, 
$\displaystyle\frac{\partial\rho\bf u}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot({\rho\bf u\otimes\bf u})=\frac{1}{\rm Re}\nabla\cdot{\Sigma}-\nabla P+\rho{\bf g^{*}}$, 
$\displaystyle\frac{\partial\rho Y_{a}}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot({\rho{\bf u}Y_{a}})=\frac{1}{{\rm ReSc}_{a}}\nabla\cdot({\sigma_{D}}\nabla Y_{a})+{\omega_{a}}$, 
$\displaystyle\nabla\cdot{\bf u}=\frac{1}{p_{0}}\left[\frac{1}{\rm RePr}\nabla\cdot({\sigma_{T}}\nabla T)+\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}{\omega_{Q}}\right]$, 
where $T=p_{0}/\rho$ and ${\bf\Sigma}=2\,{\sigma_{\mu}(T)}\,{\bf E}{+\sigma_{\lambda}\,tr({\bf E}){\bf I}}$ is the viscous stress tensor. 
Here, $\rho$, ${\bf u}$, $p_{0}$, and $P$ denote the density, velocity, thermodynamic pressure, and dynamic pressure, respectively, with $p_{0}$ assumed constant in space and time, and set to 1 atm. 
The concentration and global reaction rate of the $a^{th}$ species are represented by $Y_{a}$ and $\omega_{a}$, while $\sigma_{D}(T)$ and $\sigma_{T}(T)$ are the dimensionless mass and thermal diffusivities. 
The dynamic viscosity, Reynolds number, Prandtl number, and Schmidt number are defined as $\mu_{0}$, ${\rm Re}=\rho_{0}{U_{0}L_{0}}/\mu_{0}$, ${\rm Pr}=\mu_{0}/(\rho_{0}\alpha_{0})$, and ${\rm Sc}_{a}=\mu_{0}/(\rho_{0}{\cal D}_{a{\rm N}_{2}})$, respectively, where $U_{0}$ and $L_{0}$ are the typical velocity and length scales. 
The ratio of the constant pressure coefficient to the constant volume coefficient is denoted by $\gamma$. 
Further details on the values of the parameters and the assumptions used in modeling the mass diffusion coefficients can be found in section 2.2.

The Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the Bunsen flame is conducted using a conservative formulation on a staggered grid, where second-order central finite differences are employed. To discretize the non-linear terms in scalar equations (1) and (3), Bounded Central Difference Schemes (23) are utilized. The temporal evolution is then advanced using a low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta scheme.

The inflow boundary conditions are time-dependent and are prescribed using a fully turbulent inflow velocity, which is dynamically assigned based on a cross-sectional slice of a fully developed pipe flow simulation. This is achieved through a companion simulation of a fully turbulent periodic pipe flow, from which the turbulent velocity profile is extracted at each time step and applied to the inlet surface of the jet, creating a realistic turbulent inlet. The computational domain is a cylinder, with flow injected through an orifice in one base and exiting at the other, while the lateral surface is modeled as adiabatic and traction-free, allowing for entrainment of external fluid. The density and species concentrations are constant and uniform along the inflow orifice, and a convective Orlanski condition is applied at the outflow section.

The numerical integration commences with known fields at a generic time step $n$, including density $\rho^{n}$, momentum $(\rho{\bf u})^{n}$, and species mass fraction $(\rho Y_{a})^{n}$. Notably, for low-Mach number expansion in the present open environment configuration, the thermodynamic pressure remains constant in both space and time, allowing the temperature $T^{n}$ to be determined from the density $\rho^{n}$ via the equation of state, eq. (5). The solution algorithm proceeds as follows: the mass conservation equation is used to integrate the fluid density to time step $n+1$, yielding $\rho^{n+1}$; the momentum equation, without the hydrodynamic pressure term, is employed to find the unprojected velocity field $(\rho\bf v)^{n+1}$; and the species continuity equation advances the species mass fraction to $(\rho Y_{a})^{n+1}$, with source terms depending only on temperature, pressure, and species mass fractions at time step $n$. Finally, the velocity is projected to enforce the local divergence, which is influenced by the diffusive temperature flux and combustion heat release, using an extension of Chorin's method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, involving the solution of a linear system via the SuperLU Library (27).

The numerical code has undergone thorough testing across a range of configurations, including cold incompressible jets (25) and reactive premixed Bunsen flames (30), demonstrating its versatility and robustness.

2.2 Reduced chemical model

The chemical kinetics model has a profound impact on the dynamics of the flame, and global chemistry schemes, such as the GRI-mech 2.1, facilitate the incorporation of complex chemical features into turbulent simulations. However, these schemes often lack intermediate radicals, making them unsuitable for addressing instabilities and extinction phenomena. To address this limitation, a reduced 5-step mechanism is employed, which includes 4 radicals (H, O, OH, NO) and the main reactants (H₂, O₂, H₂O, N₂). The reduced mechanism consists of the following reactions: 1. H+O ⇌ OH, 2. H+O₂ ⇌ OH+O, 3. H₂+OH ⇌ H₂O+H, 4. H₂+O ⇌ H+OH, and 5. N₂+O₂ ⇌ 2NO. The GRI-mech scheme has been validated over a wide range of physical conditions, including temperatures between 1000 and 2500 K, pressures from 10 Torr to 10 atm, and equivalence ratios from 0.1 to 5 for premixed systems. Although the scheme assumes a quasi-steady state and local equilibrium, which may lead to inaccuracies in ignition at moderate temperatures and high pressures, this effect is deemed negligible for the present work, which focuses on statistically steady states at pressures and temperatures of $p=1\,atm$ and $300\,K<T<1550\,K$. The formation enthalpies of the species, $\Delta h_{f}^{0}$, are taken from the NASA-Lewis and Technion archives and used to compute the heat release, $\omega_{Q}=-\sum_{a=1}^{N_{s}}\Delta h_{f,a}^{0}\dot{\omega}_{a}$, where $N_{s}$ is the number of species and $\dot{\omega_{a}}$ is the global production rate of each species.

The binary mass diffusion coefficients $\mathcal{D}_{jk}$, which describe the diffusion of species $j$ into species $k$, play a significant role in determining the structure of flames and the formation of thermo-diffusive instabilities. However, accurately evaluating these coefficients is computationally expensive, as it involves solving an $N_{s}\times N_{s}$ linear system at each grid point and time step, making it a major limitation for approaches like Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). A more practical alternative is to use Fick's diffusion, which can be motivated by the Hirschfelder and Curtiss approximation. In this approach, the equivalent diffusion coefficient $D_{a}$ of a single species into the rest of the mixture can be approximated as $D_{a}=\frac{1-Y_{a}}{\sum_{j\neq a}X_{j}/\mathcal{D}_{aj}}$, where $X_{j}$ is the mole fraction of species $j$. Due to the abundance of nitrogen in air, $D_{a}$ can be further simplified to the binary diffusivity of species $j$ into nitrogen, $D_{a}\simeq\mathcal{D}_{a{\rm N_{2}}}$. The binary diffusion coefficients $\mathcal{D}_{a{\rm N_{2}}}$ can be evaluated using the assumption of binary collisions, which is valid for sufficiently diluted gases. Although this simplification reduces computational complexity, it introduces small errors near the flame front. To account for the temperature dependence of diffusivity, the Schmidt number is fixed, ${\rm Sc}_{a}=\mu_{0}/(\rho_{0}\mathcal{D}_{a{\rm N}_{2}})$, such that the mass diffusivities and thermal diffusivity inherit the temperature dependence of the dynamic viscosity, $\sigma_{\mu}(T)=\sigma_{a}(T)=\sigma_{T}(T)=(T/T_{0})^{0.5}$, following a Sutherland-like law, with the proportionality fixed by evaluating the diffusion coefficients at $298\,K$.

Given the excess of N₂ and the involved temperature range, where the burnt-to-unburnt gas temperature ratio is approximately 5 (Tₚ/Tᵤ ≃ 5), the dependence of γ on the mixture composition can be safely neglected, and a constant value of γ = 1.25 can be considered a reasonable approximation (13).

Representative computational results for a one-dimensional, planar, and stationary flame at an equivalence ratio of $\phi=0.5$ are presented in figure 2, with simulation parameters matching those of the fully 3D simulations to be discussed in the following section. The calculated adiabatic flame temperature ($T_{ad}\simeq 1555\,K$) and flame speed ($S_{L}=0.35\,m/s$) are consistent with literature values, such as those reported in (14). The top panel of figure 2 shows the mass fractions as a function of the streamwise coordinate, indicating that at this equivalence ratio, hydrogen is completely consumed, while approximately $48\%$ of $O_{2}$ remains unreacted. The reaction zone, spanning from $x=0.002\,m$ to $x=0.0035\,m$, is characterized by prominent radical concentrations. The concentration of the OH radical can be used as an indicator of the reaction progress, as observed in experimental studies of H\textsubscript{2}-lean flames (33). This is further illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 2, which plots the OH mass fraction ($Y_{\rm OH}$) against the H\textsubscript{2} mass fraction ($Y_{\rm H_{2}}$), demonstrating a relationship valid for one-dimensional laminar planar flames, here referred to as $Y_{\rm OH}=Y_{\rm OH}^{L}(Y_{{\rm H}_{2}})$. As the reaction progresses and H\textsubscript{2} is consumed, the OH mass fraction increases abruptly, reaching a peak at $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}=2\times 10^{-4}$ when the fuel is nearly exhausted, and then decreases more gradually due to slow recombination phenomena.

Our detailed description of the one-dimensional laminar flame lays the groundwork for using local turbulent fluctuations of the OH mass fraction $Y_{OH}(\mathbf{x},t)$, evaluated relative to the laminar case, as a measure of local combustion activity in turbulent flames. This approach involves statistically sampling OH and ${\rm H}_{2}$ concentrations in the turbulent flame. For a given turbulent event with $OH$ and $H_{2}$ concentrations of $Y_{\rm OH}^{T}$ and $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}^{T}$, respectively, we associate a corresponding laminar state $Y^{L}_{\rm OH}(Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}^{T})$, where $Y_{\rm OH}=Y^{L}_{\rm OH}(Y_{{\rm H}_{2}})$ represents the OH concentration profile in the laminar flame, as shown in the bottom panel of figure 2.

A positive or negative deviation in the flamelet mass fraction, referred to as a flamelet fluctuation, is denoted by $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}=Y_{\rm OH}-Y^{L}_{\rm OH}|_{Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}}$ (7) and indicates more or less chemical activity compared to the corresponding laminar state. This observable is useful for highlighting the differences between the local turbulent flame and the corresponding laminar unstretched flame, with the comparison being made by evaluating the deviation of local turbulent quantities from their laminar counterparts at the same hydrogen concentration, $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$.

2.3 Direct Numerical Simulation details

The parameters used in the DNS simulation are chosen to replicate a laboratory-scale premixed Bunsen flame of a lean H₂-Air mixture. The fuel exits a pipe with a radius of $R=0.009\,\rm m$ and a bulk velocity of $U_{0}=5\,\rm m/s$, with an equivalence ratio of $\phi=0.5$. The surrounding environment is filled with pure air at the same temperature as the fresh gas, $T=298K$. The Reynolds number is ${\rm Re}_{R}=3000$, the Prandtl number is ${\rm Pr}=0.6$, and the Froude number, which accounts for buoyancy effects, is $Fr=16.8$. The Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers at the inflow are $Da\simeq 22.3$ and $Ka\simeq 0.65$, respectively. The computational domain, spanning $2\pi\times 12R\times 14R$, is discretized using a $128\times 201\times 560$ mesh with radial stretching to capture the shear layers and flame front dynamics. The grid spacing near the nozzle exit is $\Delta\simeq 2\eta_{k}$, where $\eta_{k}$ is the Kolmogorov length scale near the pipe wall, ensuring at least four grid points across the instantaneous flame front. Further details and comparisons with experimental data can be found in reference (30), which uses an identical numerical setup to simulate a Bunsen premixed flame with a global reaction model.

Two 3D simulations were performed and analyzed: one reproducing a turbulent Bunsen flame with a turbulent inflow velocity, and the other reproducing a laminar Bunsen flame with a parabolic velocity profile at the jet inlet. To isolate the effects of turbulent fluctuations, all other parameters were held constant across the two simulations. The turbulent flame simulation was run for approximately 4.5 $R/U_{0}$ time scales in the statistical steady state, yielding about 60 uncorrelated fields collected every 0.075 $R/U_{0}$, which were used to calculate the statistics.

3 Results

This section examines the instantaneous behavior of turbulent flames, with a particular emphasis on how turbulence interacts with chemical reactions and the impact of preferential diffusion on these processes.

The top panel of Fig. 3 displays the contours of molecular hydrogen concentration $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$ on a plane containing the jet axis, extracted from the instantaneous three-dimensional field. A thin green layer represents the flame front, where $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$ exhibits significant variations as it transitions from the fresh mixture to the products. Turbulence severely wrinkles the front, creating pockets of fresh gas that are transported to the product side, where they may eventually be consumed. The flame front can be parameterized using a temperature-based progress variable $c_{T}=(T-T_{u})/(T_{ad}-T_{u})$, defined by the adiabatic flame temperature $T_{ad}$ of the inlet mixture and the temperature $T_{u}$ of the unburnt mixture.

The flame front can be identified by two distinct structures: the gullies, which are narrow, concave regions facing the fresh gas, and the bulges, which are larger, smoother regions convex towards the fresh gas. The bulges are characterized by super-adiabatic conditions, with $c_{T}$ values exceeding unity, up to 1.2, whereas the gullies exhibit sub-adiabatic conditions, with $c_{T}<1$, even in areas with low hydrogen concentration. In both regions, the isolevels of $Y_{\rm H}$ and $Y_{\rm OH}$ closely follow the flame front, as shown in figure 4, confirming their role as effective markers of combustion progress. The $Y_{\rm H}$ concentration profile is symmetric and localized near the flame front, whereas $Y_{\rm OH}$ increases sharply at the beginning of the flame front and decreases slowly towards the hot gas region, persisting well into the burnt region. The high concentration of radicals in the bulges indicates intense chemical activity, while their absence in the gullies suggests flame quenching. Figure 5 illustrates the overlap of isolines of the progress variable $c_{T}$ with the contour plot of radical concentrations, revealing an almost exact parallelism reminiscent of the lamellar structure observed in experimental results. The closer spacing of isolines in the bulges indicates steeper temperature gradients, which are associated with a reduced flame thickness and increased scalar dissipation rate, whereas the smoother gradients in the gullies are linked to lower radical concentrations and significant quenching effects.

Turbulent fluctuations can enhance flame corrugation, but this phenomenon also occurs in laminar flames, as observed in two-dimensional simulations and experiments. Lean hydrogen flames, in particular, are susceptible to differential diffusion and thermo-diffusive instabilities, which cause flame wrinkling, temperature oscillations, and possible local extinctions, regardless of whether the flame is turbulent or laminar. This instability is attributed to the high diffusivity of molecular hydrogen (H₂) and the resulting low Lewis number (Le = DT/DH₂ ≪ 1), where hydrogen diffuses towards the burnt gases much faster than heat diffuses towards the fresh gases. The ratio of hydrogen to temperature diffusion lengths is inversely proportional to the square root of the Lewis number (δH₂/δT = 1/√Le). As a result, the local curvature of the flame front leads to the enrichment of the mixture in the diffusively heated region, causing the burnt temperature to exceed that of a laminar planar flame. Conversely, in regions with negative curvature, reactants diffuse over a larger area, resulting in a decrease in flame temperature. The combination of positive and negative curvatures creates an unstable situation, which is further exacerbated by turbulent fluctuations.

The instantaneous fields revealed that combustion in lean hydrogen flames is characterized by two distinct states: highly reactive regions with super-adiabatic temperatures, referred to as "bulges", which alternate with nearly quenched areas known as "gullies" that exhibit lower temperatures. A global characterization of these states can be provided through the probability density function (pdf) of the flamelet fluctuation of OH concentration, $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$, as described in equation (7) and illustrated in figure 6.

As explained in section § 2, $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ is defined as the difference between the local turbulent concentration of radical OH and its corresponding concentration in an unstretched laminar flame with the same $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$.

Figure 6 displays the probability density function (pdf) of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ conditioned on various intervals of ${\rm H}_{2}$ concentration, enabling the analysis of different regions within the instantaneous reaction zone, from the fresh gas region (high $Y_{\rm H_{2}}$) to the burnt region (low $Y_{\rm H_{2}}$). Near the fresh gas region, as seen in plots (a) through (d) in the left panel of Figure 6, the pdf exhibits a mono-modal behavior with a slightly negative most frequent state and a pronounced positive tail, suggesting a combustion process that can be reasonably described by a flamelet approximation, albeit with intermittent events of strong chemical activity. However, as we move across the flame to plots (e) in the left panel and (f) through (h) in the right panel, the pdf of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ transitions to a bi-modal distribution, with maxima corresponding to negative and positive fluctuations, respectively. This bi-modal distribution is inconsistent with the pure flamelet regime, which would exhibit a narrow, mono-modal distribution centered at the origin. Focusing on plot (g), the two modal values represent slow ($Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}\simeq-0.001$) and fast ($Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}\simeq 0.0012$) burning states, occurring approximately 50% and 90% more frequently than the unstrained laminar state ($Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}=0$). The slow burning state appears associated with nearly quenched areas, given the local radical concentration $Y_{\rm OH}$ almost vanishes, while the fast burning state exhibits an OH concentration more than twice the laminar value. In contrast, the final stage of the turbulent reaction zone, as shown in plots (i) and (l) in the right panel of Figure 6, reverts to a mono-modal behavior, characterized by a positive mode and an intense negative tail, indicating higher chemical activity and strong intermittent events compared to the laminar flamelet.

The current turbulent lean hydrogen flame can be characterized as a bi-stable system, exhibiting two distinct states: one reacting more slowly, nearly quenched, and the other reacting more quickly than the laminar unstretched flamelet. These states prevail in the inner part of the flame, giving rise to intermittent intense-burning and quenching events that influence the fore and hind reaction regions, as evidenced by the tails in the probability distribution.

To understand the significant influence of turbulent fluctuations on flame dynamics, we examine the correlations between fluctuations in the radical $OH$, velocity gradient, and flame curvature.

The strong gas expansion in the flame can obscure the effect of local deformation induced by turbulence due to flow divergence, making it challenging to statistically characterize the turbulence-combustion interaction. However, by considering the deviatoric part of the strain rate, $\mathbf{E_{dev}}=\left(\nabla\mathbf{u}+\nabla\mathbf{u}^{T}\right)/2-\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf{I}/3$, a clearer understanding of this interaction can be achieved. This is evident in the equation for the local stretching rate $\varkappa$, which comprises three kinematic effects: gas expansion (term $I$), strain effect (term $II$), and mean curvature of the reaction front (term $III$), as expressed by $\varkappa=\frac{1}{A}\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{2}{3}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}:\mathbf{E_{dev}}+S_{d}\,(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{n})$. Notably, terms $II$ and $III$ have a significant influence on flame dynamics and exhibit a clear correlation with chemical activity, as revealed by our analysis based on equation (8).

Figure 7 presents the joint probability density function (pdf) of the deviatoric strain rate magnitude, $\mathcal{S}_{dev}=\sqrt{2\mathbf{E_{dev}}:\mathbf{E_{dev}}}$, and the fluctuation of the $OH$ radical concentration, $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$. The statistics are shown for six conditional $H_{2}$ concentrations, corresponding to the intervals denoted by letters (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i) in figure 6. In the aft part of the flame, where the $H_{2}$ concentration is high, the deviatoric strain has a negligible effect, and the $OH$ radical concentration behaves similarly to that in an unstretched, laminar flamelet. However, as we move into the reaction region (panels (c) and (d)), high deviatoric strain rates promote intense chemical activity, characterized by positive $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ values. In the hind part of the flame (panels (f) and (g)), a positive correlation between $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ and $S_{dev}$ indicates that strong burning states are associated with high deviatoric strain rates. This correlation weakens as we approach the burnt region, becoming very weak in panel (i), where the mixture is almost fully burnt. Notably, the positive mode of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ reveals a higher $OH$ radical concentration in the outer part of the turbulent flame, compared to the reference flamelet.

To better understand the contribution of different components of the strain rate, the top panel of figure 8 presents the joint probability density function (jpdf) of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ and the deviatoric strain rate component aligned with the flame normal, $D_{nn}=\mathbf{E_{dev}}:\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}$, which corresponds to term II of equation (8). The analysis reveals a weak positive correlation near the fresh gas, as seen in panels (b) and (c). As we move through the flame front towards the burnt gas, the correlation becomes increasingly positive, evident in panel (d). In the middle of the flame front, panels (f) and (g) exhibit a bi-modal behavior with a positive correlation between $Y_{{\rm OH}}^{\prime}$ and $D_{nn}=2/3\,\partial u_{n}/\partial n-1/3\,\nabla_{\pi}\cdot\mathbf{u}_{\pi}$, where $\nabla_{\pi}$ is the gradient component tangent to the ideal flame surface. For comparison, the corresponding unstretched laminar flame, characterized by $D_{nn}^{L}=2/3\,\partial u_{n}/\partial n$, is represented by black circles in the figure panels. Notably, the most probable states of the turbulent flame are either more active ($Y_{\rm OH}^{\prime}>0$) or less active ($Y_{\rm OH}^{\prime}<0$) than the laminar flame, with $D_{nn}>D_{nn}^{L}$.

A second important consideration is the impact of local flame curvature, given by $k=\nabla\cdot\mathbf{n}=-\left(\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_{2}}\right)$, where $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ are the principal curvature radii of the flame surface, which distinguishes between bulges (negative curvature) and gullies (positive curvature). As illustrated in Figure 9, the joint probability density function (jpdf) of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ and mean curvature $k$ reveals a significant relationship between curvature and OH radical concentration. In the fresh gas region, shown in panel (b), curvature has a negligible effect, but as one moves towards the burnt gas region, panels (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i), a clear negative correlation emerges, indicating that intense burning tends to occur in areas with pronounced negative curvature (bulges), while quenching is more characteristic of regions with positive curvature (gullies).

The flame curvature can also alter the local ratio of hydrogen to oxygen due to the different diffusion coefficients of the species, a phenomenon well-known in laminar lean hydrogen flames where thermo-diffusive instabilities occur. To quantify this effect, the atomic equivalence ratio is defined as $\phi=\frac{1}{2}\frac{X_{\rm H}+X_{\rm OH}+2\,X_{{\rm H}_{2}{\rm O}}+2\,X_{{\rm H}_{2}}}{X_{\rm O}+X_{\rm OH}+X_{\rm NO}+X_{{\rm H}_{2}{\rm O}}+2\,X_{{\rm O}_{2}}}$, where $X_{i}$ denotes the molar fraction of the $i$-species. In the present case, the atomic equivalence ratio $\phi$ remains constant throughout the reaction if the species have the same diffusion coefficients. However, in reality, the entrainment of cold air from the environment can dilute the unburned mixture, although this event is rare as mixing typically occurs between hot burnt gases and cold ambient air. The joint probability distribution function (jpdf) of $\phi$ and the mean curvature $k$ inside the flame front is shown in Figure 10 for the same $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$ ranges as Figure 7. The results indicate that at the beginning of the flame front, the curvature has a negligible effect on the atomic equivalence ratio, whereas in the middle of the flame front, a strong anti-correlation between the curvature and the atomic equivalence ratio is observed. Specifically, fronts with positive curvature exhibit low values of the atomic equivalence ratio, leading to quenched states, while fronts with negative curvature exhibit enriched mixtures, resulting in higher chemical activity and super-adiabaticity. Furthermore, the most probable atomic equivalence fraction is often higher than the corresponding laminar one, approaching the nominal value of $\phi=0.5$, suggesting that turbulent fluctuations contribute to homogenizing the mixture towards the nominal equivalence ratio. As the reaction region approaches its end, the most frequent state is that of bulges with high atomic equivalence ratio, and the departure of the atomic equivalence ratio from its nominal bulk value occurs only within the flame, recovering the nominal value ahead and behind the flame.

This subsection compares $H_{2}$ /Air Bunsen flames with steady laminar and unsteady turbulent inflow to investigate the impact of turbulence on thermo-diffusive instability. The absence of noise in the laminar inflow prevents the observation of transition to turbulence. Figure 11 shows instantaneous flame surfaces for both turbulent and laminar inflow Bunsen flames, with the turbulent flame appearing shorter and more wrinkled due to enhanced burning speed caused by turbulent fluctuations. The laminar flame surface is smooth, except for corrugations at the tip. Both flames exhibit super-burning regions, but the turbulent flame also features flame quenching cusps in the gullies, denoted by intense negative values of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$. In contrast, the laminar Bunsen flame has almost no cusps, with $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}\simeq 0$. The figure also illustrates the different paths taken by thermo-diffusive instabilities in laminar and turbulent flames, with the turbulent case influenced by coherent structures from the pipe flow. These structures control the front curvature, triggering corrugations and generating super-burning and quenched regions. The statistical characterization of these behaviors is presented in Figure 12, which shows the probability density function of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ conditioned to different $H_{2}$ concentration levels. The results indicate that the laminar flame exhibits a mono-modal behavior, while the turbulent case shows a bi-modal distribution, with a negative fluctuation peak corresponding to quenched regions. The analysis suggests that turbulence is the source of the observed bi-modal behavior, producing corrugations that trigger thermo-diffusive instability and lead to local flame quenching. In contrast, the laminar flame develops super-burning regions through thermo-diffusive instability, but without significant local quenching. The thermo-diffusive instability evolves slowly in the laminar flame, while turbulent fluctuations are faster and stronger, preventing the formation of cellular structures and setting the time scale of the turbulent flame.

3.1 Instantaneous configurations

This section examines the instantaneous behavior of turbulent flames, with a particular emphasis on how turbulence and chemical reactions interact, as well as the impact of preferential diffusion on this complex process.

The top panel of Fig. 3 displays the contours of molecular hydrogen concentration $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$ on a plane containing the jet axis, extracted from the instantaneous three-dimensional field. A thin green layer represents the flame front, where $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$ exhibits significant variations as it transitions from the fresh mixture to the products. Turbulence severely wrinkles the front, creating pockets of fresh gas that are transported to the product side, where they may eventually be consumed. The flame front can be parameterized using a temperature-based progress variable $c_{T}=(T-T_{u})/(T_{ad}-T_{u})$, defined by the adiabatic flame temperature $T_{ad}$ of the inlet mixture and the temperature $T_{u}$ of the unburnt mixture.

The flame front is characterized by two distinct structures: gullies, which are narrow, concave regions facing the fresh gas, and bulges, which are larger, smoother regions convex towards the fresh gas. The bulges exhibit super-adiabatic conditions, with $c_{T}$ values exceeding unity, up to 1.2, whereas gullies are sub-adiabatic, with $c_{T}<1$, even in areas with low hydrogen concentration. Both regions have isolevels of $Y_{\rm H}$ and $Y_{\rm OH}$ that closely follow the flame front, confirming their role as indicators of combustion progress. The $Y_{\rm H}$ concentration profile is symmetric and localized near the flame front, whereas $Y_{\rm OH}$ increases sharply at the flame front and decreases slowly towards the hot gas region, persisting well into the burnt region. The high radical concentration in bulges indicates intense chemical activity, while their absence in gullies suggests flame quenching. The progress variable $c_{T}$ isolines, shown in figure 5, overlap with the radical concentration contours and exhibit a lamellar structure, with steeper temperature gradients in bulges and smoother gradients in gullies. This results in reduced flame thickness and increased scalar dissipation rate in bulges, while gullies experience reduced radical concentrations and significant quenching effects.

Turbulent fluctuations can enhance flame corrugation, but this phenomenon also occurs in two-dimensional simulations and experiments on laminar flames. In fact, lean hydrogen flames are particularly susceptible to differential diffusion and thermo-diffusive instabilities, which cause flame wrinkling, temperature oscillations, and potential local extinctions, regardless of whether the flame is turbulent or laminar. This instability is driven by the high diffusivity of molecular hydrogen (H₂) and the resulting low Lewis number, Le = DT/DH₂ ≪ 1, where hydrogen diffuses towards the burnt gases much faster than heat diffuses towards the fresh gases. The ratio of hydrogen to temperature diffusion lengths is inversely proportional to the square root of the Lewis number, δH₂/δT = 1/√Le. As a result, the local curvature of the flame front leads to the enrichment of the mixture in the diffusively heated region, causing the burnt gas temperature to exceed that of a laminar planar flame. Conversely, in regions with negative curvature, reactants diffuse over a larger area, resulting in a decrease in flame temperature. The combination of positive and negative curvatures creates an unstable situation, which is further exacerbated by turbulent fluctuations.

3.2 Statistical analysis

The instantaneous fields revealed that combustion in lean hydrogen flames occurs in two distinct states: highly reactive regions with super-adiabatic temperatures, referred to as "bulges", which alternate with nearly quenched areas known as "gullies" that exhibit lower temperatures. A global characterization of these states can be obtained through the probability density function (pdf) of the flamelet fluctuation of OH concentration, $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$, as expressed in equation (7) and illustrated in figure 6.

As explained in section § 2, $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ is defined as the difference between the local turbulent concentration of radical OH and its corresponding concentration in an unstretched laminar flame with the same $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}$.

Figure 6 illustrates the probability density function (pdf) of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ conditioned on various intervals of ${\rm H}_{2}$ concentration, enabling the analysis of different regions within the instantaneous reaction zone, from the fresh gas (high $Y_{\rm H_{2}}$) to the burnt region (low $Y_{\rm H_{2}}$). Near the fresh gas region, as seen in plots (a) through (d) in the left panel of figure 6, the pdf exhibits a mono-modal behavior with a slightly negative most frequent state and a pronounced positive tail, suggesting a combustion process that can be reasonably described by a flamelet approximation, albeit with intense intermittent events characterized by strong chemical activity. However, as we proceed across the flame, observing plots (e) in the left panel and (f) through (h) in the right panel, the pdf of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ transitions to a bi-modal distribution, featuring maxima corresponding to both negative and positive fluctuations. This bi-modality is inconsistent with the pure flamelet regime, which would manifest as a narrow, mono-modal distribution centered at the origin. Focusing on plot (g), the two modal values of the distribution, approximately $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}\simeq-0.001$ and $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}\simeq 0.0012$, represent slow and fast burning states, occurring almost $50\%$ and $90\%$ more frequently than the unstrained laminar state. The slow burning state appears associated with nearly quenched areas, given the local radical concentration $Y_{\rm OH}$ almost vanishes, while the fast burning state is characterized by an OH concentration more than twice the laminar value. In contrast, towards the end of the turbulent reaction zone, plots (i) and (l) in the right panel of Fig. 6 show a return to a mono-modal behavior, albeit with a positive mode and an intense negative tail, indicating higher chemical activity and strong intermittent events compared to the laminar flamelet.

The current turbulent lean hydrogen flame can be characterized as a bi-stable system, exhibiting two distinct states: one reacting relatively slowly, nearly quenched, and the other reacting more quickly, both differing from the laminar unstretched flamelet. These states predominantly occur in the inner part of the flame, where they intermittently influence the fore and hind reaction regions through intense burning and quenching events, respectively, as evident from the probability distribution function (pdf) tails.

To understand the significant influence of turbulent fluctuations on flame dynamics, we examine the correlations between fluctuations in the radical $OH$, velocity gradient, and flame curvature.

The strong gas expansion in the flame can obscure the effect of local deformation induced by turbulence due to flow divergence. To better statistically characterize the turbulence-combustion interaction, it is more effective to consider the deviatoric part of the strain rate, $\mathbf{E_{dev}}=\left(\nabla\mathbf{u}+\nabla\mathbf{u}^{T}\right)/2-\left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf{I}/3$, which appears in the equation for the local stretching rate $\varkappa$ (13). The stretching rate, given by $\varkappa=\frac{1}{A}\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{2}{3}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}:\mathbf{E_{dev}}+S_{d}\,(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{n})$ (8), incorporates three kinematic effects: gas expansion associated with heat release during combustion (term $I$), the strain effect (term $II$), and the mean curvature of the reaction front (term $III$). Notably, the latter two terms significantly influence flame dynamics and exhibit a clear correlation with chemical activity, as evidenced by equation (8).

Figure 7 presents the joint probability density function (pdf) of the deviatoric strain rate magnitude, $\mathcal{S}_{dev}=\sqrt{2\mathbf{E_{dev}}:\mathbf{E_{dev}}}$, and the flamelet fluctuation of the $OH$ radical concentration, $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$. The statistics are shown for six conditional $H_{2}$ concentrations, corresponding to the intervals denoted by letters (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i) in figure 6. In the aft part of the flame, where the $H_{2}$ concentration is high, the deviatoric strain has a negligible effect, and the $OH$ radical concentration behaves similarly to that in an unstretched, laminar flamelet. However, as we move into the reaction region (panels (c) and (d)), high deviatoric strain promotes intense chemical activity, resulting in a positive $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$. In the hind part of the flame (panels (f) and (g)), a strong positive correlation between $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ and $S_{dev}$ indicates that high deviatoric strain rates are associated with strong burning states. This correlation weakens as we approach the burnt region, becoming very weak in panel (i), where the mixture is almost fully burnt. Notably, the positive mode of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ reveals a higher $OH$ radical concentration in the outer part of the turbulent flame, compared to the reference flamelet.

To elucidate the contribution of different strain rate components, the top panel of figure 8 presents the joint probability density function (jpdf) of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ and the deviatoric strain rate component aligned with the flame normal ${\bf n}$, denoted as $D_{nn}=\mathbf{E_{dev}}:\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{n}$, which corresponds to term II of equation (8). A weak positive correlation is observed near the fresh gas, as shown in panels (b) and (c). As we move through the flame front towards the burnt gas, the correlation becomes increasingly positive, as evident in panel (d). In the middle of the flame front, panels (f) and (g) exhibit a bi-modal behavior with a positive correlation between $Y_{{\rm OH}}^{\prime}$ and $D_{nn}=2/3\,\partial u_{n}/\partial n-1/3\,\nabla_{\pi}\cdot\mathbf{u}_{\pi}$, where $\nabla_{\pi}$ represents the gradient component tangent to the ideal flame surface. For comparison, the corresponding unstretched laminar flame, characterized by $D_{nn}^{L}=2/3\,\partial u_{n}/\partial n$, is indicated by black circles in the figure panels. Notably, the most probable states of the turbulent flame are either more active ($Y_{\rm OH}^{\prime}>0$) or less active ($Y_{\rm OH}^{\prime}<0$) than the laminar flame, with $D_{nn}$ exceeding $D_{nn}^{L}$.

A second key aspect is the impact of local flame curvature, defined by the expression $k=\nabla\cdot\mathbf{n}=-\left(\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_{2}}\right)$ (9), where $\mathcal{R}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{2}$ are the principal curvature radii of the flame surface, distinguishing between bulges (negative curvature) and gullies (positive curvature). The relationship between curvature and OH radical concentration is illustrated in Figure 9, which shows the flame-conditioned joint probability density function (jpdf) of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ and mean curvature $k$. Notably, the curvature has a negligible effect on OH radical concentration near the fresh gases, as seen in panel (b). However, as one moves towards the burnt gas region, panels (c), (d), (f), (g), and (i) reveal a clear negative correlation, indicating that intense burning tends to occur in areas with prominent negative curvature (bulges), whereas quenching is more characteristic of regions with positive curvature (gullies).

The flame curvature can also alter the local ratio of hydrogen to oxygen due to differences in diffusion coefficients, a phenomenon well-known in laminar lean hydrogen flames where thermo-diffusive instabilities occur. To quantify this effect, an atomic equivalence ratio $\phi$ is defined, based on the local number of H and O atoms, as $\phi=\frac{1}{2}\frac{X_{\rm H}+X_{\rm OH}+2\,X_{{\rm H}_{2}{\rm O}}+2\,X_{{\rm H}_{2}}}{X_{\rm O}+X_{\rm OH}+X_{\rm NO}+X_{{\rm H}_{2}{\rm O}}+2\,X_{{\rm O}_{2}}}$, where $X_{i}$ denotes the molar fraction of species $i$. This ratio remains constant throughout the reaction if species have equal diffusion coefficients. However, in the present case, the entrainment of cold air from the environment can cause dilution of the unburned mixture, although this is rare as mixing typically occurs between hot burnt gases and cold ambient air. The joint probability density function (jpdf) of $\phi$ and mean curvature $k$ inside the flame front, shown in Figure 10, reveals that at the beginning of the flame front, curvature has a negligible effect on $\phi$, with the jpdf being almost flat around the corresponding laminar unstretched value. In contrast, in the middle of the flame front, a strong anti-correlation between curvature and $\phi$ is observed, with positively curved fronts (gullies) exhibiting low $\phi$ values and negatively curved fronts (bulges) showing enriched mixtures. Notably, turbulent fluctuations appear to homogenize the mixture towards the nominal equivalence ratio, with $\phi$ often being closer to the nominal bulk value than to the laminar unstrained flame value. As the reaction region progresses, the most frequent state becomes that of bulges with high atomic equivalence ratios, and the nominal value is recovered ahead and behind the flame.

3.3 Turbulent vs Laminar Bunsen flame comparison

This subsection compares $H_{2}$ /Air Bunsen flames fueled by steady laminar and unsteady turbulent inflows to investigate the impact of turbulence on thermo-diffusive instability. Since the laminar inflow lacks noise, transition to turbulence is not observed in this case. Figure 11 displays instantaneous flame surfaces for both turbulent and laminar inflows, with the surfaces represented by $Y_{{\rm H}_{2}}=0.015$ isolevels colored by OH radical flamelet fluctuation $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$. The turbulent flame appears shorter, indicating enhanced burning speed due to turbulent fluctuations, and its surface is significantly wrinkled, whereas the laminar flame has corrugations only at the tip and is smooth in the lower part. Both flames exhibit super-burning regions, but flame quenching cusps are present in the turbulent case, denoted by intense negative $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ values, while they are almost absent in the laminar flame. The figure also illustrates the different paths of thermo-diffusive instabilities in laminar and turbulent flames, with the laminar case slowly evolving downstream and the turbulent case influenced by turbulent coherent structures. The statistical characterization of these behaviors is discussed, with Figure 12 providing the probability density function of $Y^{\prime}_{\rm OH}$ conditioned to different H \textsubscript{2} concentration levels. The results show that the laminar flame exhibits a mono-modal behavior, while the turbulent case displays a bi-modal distribution, indicating the presence of quenched regions. The study concludes that turbulence alters the dynamics of thermo-diffusive instability, introducing local quenching and modifying the flame front's corrugations, whereas in laminar flames, super-burning regions are naturally developed without quenching.

4 Final remarks

The paper examines DNS data from a turbulent Bunsen flame fueled by a lean premixed mixture of molecular hydrogen and air, revealing a combustion process characterized by two primary states: intense burning cells interspersed with nearly quenched regions. Statistical analysis and instantaneous behavior observations indicate that strong burning cells are associated with bulges, areas convex towards the fresh gases, while quenched areas are linked to gullies, regions convex towards the burnt gases. To further investigate this behavior, a statistical analysis was conditioned on local hydrogen concentration, allowing for a detailed examination of the reaction region from fresh to burnt gases. The results show that, within the flame front, the bi-modal states occur more frequently than their laminar counterparts, suggesting that the flame is primarily composed of these two states. A positive correlation was found between deviatoric strain rate and local chemical activity, with heat release-induced expansion causing greater deformation normal to the flame front, particularly in strong burning cells. Analysis of front curvature implies that thermo-diffusive instabilities are the origin of this bi-stable behavior, driven by local curvature-induced enrichment or dilution of the mixture, resulting in alternating strong burning cells and quenched regions. The local curvature correlates with the local equivalence ratio, producing the observed bimodal behavior, with spatially alternating enrichment and depletion of the mixture along the flame front. Given the fixed bulk equivalence ratio of $\Phi=0.5$, these fluctuations correspond to variations in adiabatic combustion temperature. The simulation suggests that turbulent fluctuations initially distort the flame front, triggering instabilities that subsequently impact local chemical activity, yielding a consistent picture of the combustion process at moderate Reynolds numbers.

In addition to the regions deep within the reaction zone, a mono-modal behavior, similar to that of an unstretched laminar flame, is also observed in the outermost parts of the flame, near the fresh and burned gases. Nevertheless, the bi-stable dynamics still exert an influence on these peripheral regions, as evidenced by the pronounced tails in the probability density function of the flamelet OH concentration.

A comparison between turbulent and laminar inflow Bunsen flames provided insight into the impact of turbulent fluctuations. In contrast to the turbulent flame, the laminar flame exhibits a distinct cellular shape near its tip, driven by thermo-diffusive instability, and its process is always mono-modal. Notably, our analysis revealed a high statistical incidence of super-burning states in the laminar flame, without any locally quenched regions. This suggests that super-burning behavior can develop naturally through thermo-diffusive instability, even in the absence of turbulent fluctuations, which are necessary for the formation of quenched regions and the subsequent creation of gullies.

These results have significant implications for modeling turbulent flames at low Lewis numbers using the flamelet assumption, as local flame characteristics often deviate substantially from those of an unstretched laminar flame. Specifically, flame models must account for the bi-stable nature of turbulent flames, which typically exhibit two distinct local states: a super-adiabatic state and an almost quenched state.
