On another extension of coherent pairs of measures

By K. Castillo and D. Mbouna

Abstract

Let $M$ and $N$ be fixed non-negative integer numbers and let $\pi_{N}$ be a polynomial of degree $N$ . Suppose that $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are two orthogonal polynomial sequences such that $\pi_{N}(x)\,P_{n+m}^{(m)}(x)=\sum_{j=n-M}^{n+N}r_{n,j}Q_{j+k}^{(k)}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\,,$ where $r_{n,j}$ are complex number independent of $x$ . It is shown that under natural constraints, $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are semiclassical orthogonal polynomial sequences. Moreover, their corresponding moment linear functionals are related by a rational modification in the distributional sense. This leads to the concept of $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ .

1. Introduction

In the framework of the theory of orthogonal polynomials —for an updated reference on this subject we refer the reader to Ismail’s book [8] —, the concept of coherent pair of measures as well as its multiple generalizations have been a subject of increasing research interest along the last decades. This concept was introduced by Iserles et al. [7] motivated by the theory of polynomial approximation with respect to certain Sobolev inner products. In [11] , the notion of $(M,N)-$ coherent pair, and of $(M,N)-$ coherent pair of order $(m,k)$ , were introduced as extensions of most of the concepts of coherence up to that time. More precisely, given two monic orthogonal polynomial sequences (OPS), $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , we say that $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ is an $(M,N)-$ coherent pair of order $(m,k)$ if there exist two non-negative integer numbers $M$ and $N$ , and sequences of complex numbers $(a_{n,j})_{n\geq 0}$ ( $j=0,1,\ldots,M$ ) and $(b_{n,j})_{n\geq 0}$ ( $j=0,1,\ldots,N$ ) such that, under natural assumptions on the coefficients $a_{n,j}$ and $b_{n,j}$ , the structure relation 
 
 $\sum_{j=0}^{M}a_{n,j}P_{n-j}^{[m]}(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{N}b_{n,j}Q_{n-j}^{[k]}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)$ 
 holds. Here and subsequently, we use the notation 
 
 $P_{n}^{[m]}(x):=\frac{1}{(n+1)_{m}}\frac{{\rm d}^{m}}{{\rm d}x^{m}}\,P_{n+m}(x)$ 
 ( $Q_{n}^{[k]}$ is defined in the same way), where for any positive real number $\alpha$ , $(\alpha)_{n}$ denotes the Pochhammer symbol defined by 
 
 $(\alpha)_{0}:=1\;,\quad(\alpha)_{n}:=\alpha(\alpha+1)\cdots(\alpha+n-1)\quad\mbox{\rm if}\quad n\in\mathbb{N}\;.$ 
 Note that $P_{n}^{[m]}$ is a normalization of the derivative of order $m$ of $P_{n+m}$ defined so that it becomes a monic polynomial of degree $n$ . Let u and v be the moment regular functionals with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are orthogonal. It follows from the results in [17] that if $m=k$ then u and v are connected by a rational transformation (in the distributional sense), i.e., there exist nonzero polynomials $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ such that $\Phi\textbf{u}=\Psi\textbf{v}$ . Otherwise if $m\neq k$ then u and v are still connected by a rational transformation and, in addition, they are semiclassical functionals, i.e., there exist nonzero polynomials $\Phi_{1}$ , $\Psi_{1}$ , $\Phi_{2}$ , and $\Psi_{2}$ such that 
 
 $D(\Phi_{1}{\bf u})=\Psi_{1}{\bf u}\;,\quad D(\Phi_{2}{\bf v})=\Psi_{2}{\bf v}\;.$ 
 In agreement with the ‘algebraic theory’ of OPS introduced by Maroni [15] , the left product of a polynomial $\Phi$ by a moment functional w is the functional, $\Phi{\bf w}$ , defined by $\langle\Phi\textbf{w},p\rangle:=\langle\textbf{w},\Phi p\rangle$ for each polynomial $p$ , whereas the derivative of ${\bf w}$ , $D{\bf w}$ , is defined by $\langle D\textbf{w},p\rangle:=-\langle\textbf{w},p^{\prime}\rangle$ , for each polynomial $p$ . As usual, $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ means the duality bracket, so that $\langle{\bf w},p\rangle$ is the action of the functional ${\bf w}$ over the polynomial $p$ .

In this work we modify the left-hand side of the above structure relation, and consider the following one: 
 
 (1.1)  $\pi_{N}(x)P_{n}^{[m]}(x)=\sum_{j=n-M}^{n+N}c_{n,j}Q_{j}^{[k]}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\,,$ 
 where $M$ and $N$ are fixed non-negative integer numbers, $\pi_{N}$ is a monic polynomial of degree $N$ (hence $c_{n,n+N}=1$ for each $n$ ), and we consider the convention $Q_{j}\equiv 0$ if $j<0$ . Further, we will assume that the following conditions hold: 
 
 (1.2)  $c_{n,n-M}\neq 0\quad\mbox{\rm if}\quad n\geq M\;.$ 
 Maroni and Sfaxi [16] considered the case $(m,k)=(0,1)$ and called the pair $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ fulfilling the structure relation ( 1.1 ) whenever $(m,k)=(0,1)$ a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ . This motivates the following

Let $M$ and $N$ be non-negative integer numbers and let $\pi_{N}$ be a monic polynomial of degree $N$ . If $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are two monic OPS such that their normalized derivatives of orders $m$ and $k$ (respectively) satisfy $(\ref{1b})$ – $(\ref{cond1})$ , we call $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ , as well as the corresponding pair $({\bf u},{\bf v})$ of regular functionals, a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ .

Besides [16] , many other instances of the structure relation ( 1.1 ) were considered previously by several authors. For instance, the case $N=0$ (i.e., $\pi_{N}\equiv 1$ and $M$ , $m$ , and $k$ being arbitrary) fits into the theory of $(M,0)-$ coherent pairs of order $(m,k)$ , described at the begin of this introduction. Also, whenever $(m,k)=(1,0)$ and $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}\equiv(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , $(\ref{1b})$ becomes a characterization of semiclassical OPS due to Maroni [14] . Note that for $N\leq 2$ and $M=0$ , this reduces to the well known Al-Salam-Chihara characterization of the classical OPS [1] . The case $k=0$ ( $M$ , $N$ and $m$ being arbitrary) was considered by Bonan et al. [3] in the framework of orthogonality in the positive-definite sense, i.e., whenever the orthogonality of each of the involved OPS is considered with respect to positive Borel measures. In the special case $m=1$ , a complementary approach to the case considered in [3] was presented in [12] , in the framework of the so-called regular (or formal) orthogonality.

It is a remarkable fact that in all the previous works the involved OPS and their corresponding regular moment linear functionals are semiclassical. Thus, a major question is to analyze whether the OPS involved in a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ are semiclassical, and in such a case to determine the relations between the corresponding regular moment linear functionals. This will be treated in Section 2 . As an application, in Section 3 , we present an alternative approach to a recent result due to Griffin [5] , which fits into $\pi_{1}-$ coherence with index $1$ and order $(1,0)$ .

2. Main results

In this section we establish the semiclassical character of the OPS and their associated regular functionals involved in a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ . Our approach is based upon the algebraic theory of orthogonal polynomials developed by Maroni [13] . We denote by $\mathcal{P}$ the vector space of all (complex) polynomials and by $\mathcal{P}^{*}$ its algebraic dual space. $\mathcal{P}$ may be endowed with a topology (indeed, an appropriate strict inductive limit topology) such that the algebraic and the topological dual spaces of $\mathcal{P}$ coincide, that is, $\mathcal{P}^{*}=\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ . Given a simple set of polynomials $(R_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ (meaning that each $R_{n}\in\mathcal{P}$ and $\deg R_{n}=n$ for each $n=0,1,\ldots$ ), the corresponding dual basis is a sequence of linear functionals ${\bf e}_{n}:\mathcal{P}\to\mathbb{C}$ such that 
 
 $\langle{\bf e}_{n},R_{j}\rangle:=\delta_{n,j}\quad(n,j=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 where $\delta_{n,j}$ denotes the Kronecker’s symbol. In particular, if $(R_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ is a monic OPS with respect to ${\bf w}\in\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ , i.e., there exists a sequence of nonzero complex numbers $(k_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ such that the orthogonality conditions 
 
 $\langle{\bf w},R_{j}R_{n}\rangle:=k_{n}\delta_{j,n}\quad(j,n=0,1,\ldots)$ 
 hold, then the corresponding dual basis is explicitly given by 
 
 ${\bf e}_{n}=k_{n}^{-1}R_{n}{\rm w}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;.$ 


Let $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ be a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ , so that $(\ref{1b})$ – $(\ref{cond1})$ hold. Set 
 
 (2.1)  $\displaystyle\psi(x;n):=\sum_{j=n-N}^{n+M}\frac{(-1)^{m}(j+1)_{m}\;c_{j,n}}{\langle{\bf u},P_{m+j}^{2}\rangle}P_{m+j}(x)\;,$ 
 
 (2.2)  $\displaystyle\phi(x;n,j):=\frac{(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}}{\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle}\sum_{\ell=0}^{N-j}\binom{k+N}{\ell}\binom{N-\ell}{N-j-\ell}\pi_{N}^{(\ell)}(x)Q_{n+k}^{(N-j-\ell)}(x)\,,$ 
 for all $\,n=0,1,\ldots$ and $j=0,1,\ldots,N$ , so that 
 
 $\deg\psi(\cdot;n)=m+n+M\;,\quad\deg\phi(\cdot;n,j)=k+n+j\;.$ 
 Let ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ be the regular functionals with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are orthogonal. Then the following functional equations hold: 
 
 (2.3)  $\displaystyle\psi(\cdot;n){\bf u}=D^{m-k-N}\left(\sum_{j=0}^{N}\phi(\cdot;n,j)D^{j}{\bf v}\right)$ $\displaystyle\mbox{\rm if}\quad m\geq k+N\;,$ 
 
 (2.4)  $\displaystyle D^{k+N-m}\big{(}\psi(\cdot;n){\bf u}\big{)}=\sum_{j=0}^{N}\phi(\cdot;n,j)D^{j}{\bf v}$ $\displaystyle\mbox{\rm if}\quad m<k+N\;,$ 
 for all $n=0,1,\ldots$ .

Let $({\bf a}_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , $({\bf b}_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , $({\bf a}_{n}^{[m]})_{n\geq 0}$ , and $({\bf b}_{n}^{[k]})_{n\geq 0}$ be the dual basis corresponding to the simple sets of polynomials $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , $(P_{n}^{[m]})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n}^{[k]})_{n\geq 0}$ , respectively. Then 
 
 $\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}=\sum_{j=0}^{+\infty}\big{\langle}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]},P_{j}^{[m]}\big{\rangle}\,{\bf a}_{j}^{[m]}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)$ 
 (in the sense of the weak dual topology in $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ ). From $(\ref{1b})$ , we have 
 
 $\displaystyle\big{\langle}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]},P_{j}^{[m]}\big{\rangle}$ $\displaystyle=\big{\langle}b_{n}^{[k]},\pi_{N}P_{j}^{[m]}\big{\rangle}=\sum_{\ell=j-M}^{j+N}c_{j,\ell}\big{\langle}b_{n}^{[k]},Q_{\ell}^{[k]}\big{\rangle}$ 
 
 $\displaystyle=\begin{cases}c_{j,n}&\mbox{\rm if }\quad n-N\leq j\leq n+M\\
0&\mbox{\rm otherwise\,. }\end{cases}$ 
 Hence 
 
 (2.5)  $\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}=\sum_{j=n-N}^{n+M}c_{j,n}{\bf a}_{j}^{[m]}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;.$ 
 Considering the $m$ -th derivative on both sides of this equation and taking into account that $D^{m}\big{(}{\bf a}_{j}^{[m]}\big{)}=(-1)^{m}(j+1)_{m}{\bf a}_{j+m}$ , we obtain 
 
 (2.6)  $D^{m}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}=\psi(\cdot;n)\textbf{u}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 where $\psi(\cdot;n)$ is defined by ( 2.1 ). Notice that the condition ( 1.2 ) ensures that $\deg\psi(\cdot,n)=M+m+n$ for each $n=0,1,\ldots$ . Using the Leibniz rule for the derivative of the left product of a functional by a polynomial, and taking into account that $\pi_{N}^{(j)}=0$ if $j>N$ , as well as 
 
 $D^{k}\big{(}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}=(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}{\bf b}_{n+k}=(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle^{-1}Q_{n+k}{\bf v}\,,$ 
 we deduce 
 
 $\displaystyle D^{k+N}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}$ 
 
 $\displaystyle\qquad=\frac{(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}}{\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle}\sum_{j=0}^{N}\binom{k+N}{j}\pi_{N}^{(j)}D^{N-j}(Q_{n+k}{\bf v})$ 
 
 $\displaystyle\qquad=\frac{(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}}{\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle}\sum_{j=0}^{N}\sum_{\ell=0}^{N-j}\binom{k+N}{j}\binom{N-j}{\ell}\pi_{N}^{(j)}Q_{n+k}^{(\ell)}D^{N-j-\ell}{\bf v}$ 
 
 $\displaystyle\qquad=\frac{(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}}{\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle}\sum_{j=0}^{N}\sum_{\ell=j}^{N}\binom{k+N}{j}\binom{N-j}{\ell-j}\pi_{N}^{(j)}Q_{n+k}^{(\ell-j)}D^{N-\ell}{\bf v}$ 
 
 $\displaystyle\qquad=\frac{(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}}{\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle}\sum_{\ell=0}^{N}\sum_{j=0}^{\ell}\binom{k+N}{j}\binom{N-j}{\ell-j}\pi_{N}^{(j)}Q_{n+k}^{(\ell-j)}D^{N-\ell}{\bf v}$ 
 
 $\displaystyle\qquad=\sum_{\nu=0}^{N}\left(\frac{(-1)^{k}(n+1)_{k}}{\langle{\bf v},Q_{n+k}^{2}\rangle}\sum_{j=0}^{N-\nu}\binom{k+N}{j}\binom{N-j}{N-\nu-j}\pi_{N}^{(j)}Q_{n+k}^{(N-\nu-j)}\right)D^{\nu}{\bf v}\;.$ 
 Hence, by ( 2.2 ), we obtain 
 
 (2.7)  $D^{k+N}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}=\sum_{j=0}^{N}\phi(\cdot;n,j)D^{j}{\bf v}\;.$ 
 If $m\geq k+N$ , we rewrite ( 2.6 ) as 
 
 (2.8)  $\psi(\cdot;n){\bf u}=D^{m-k-N}D^{k+N}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 and ( 2.3 ) follows from ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ). If $m<k+N$ , writing 
 
 $D^{k+N}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}=D^{k-m+N}D^{m}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\big{)}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 we see that ( 2.4 ) follows from ( 2.6 ) and ( 2.7 ). ∎

Let us first consider the case $m\geq k+N$ .

Let $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ be a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ , so that $(\ref{1b})$ – $(\ref{cond1})$ holds. Let ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ be the regular functionals with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are orthogonal. Suppose $m\geq k+N$ . Assume further that $m>k$ whenever $N=0$ . For each $i=0,\ldots,m-k$ and $n=0,1,\ldots$ , let 
 
 (2.9)  $\varphi(x;n,i):=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}j+\ell=i\\
0\leq j\leq N\\
0\leq\ell\leq M\end{subarray}}\binom{m-k-N}{\ell}\big{(}\phi(x;n,j)\big{)}^{(m-k-N-\ell)}\;,$ 
 $\phi(\cdot;n,j)$ being the polynomial introduced in $(\ref{fi})$ . Let $\mathcal{A}(x)$ be the polynomial matrix of order $m-k+1$ defined by 
 
 $\mathcal{A}(x):=\big{[}\varphi(x;n,j)\big{]}_{n,j=0}^{m-k}\;.$ 
 Let $\mathcal{A}_{1}(x)$ (resp., $\mathcal{A}_{2}(x)$ ) be the matrix obtained by replacing the first (resp., the second) column of $\mathcal{A}(x)$ by $\big{[}\psi(x;0),\psi(x;1),\cdots,\psi(x;m-k)]^{t}$ , and set 
 
 $A(x):=\det\mathcal{A}(x)\;,\quad A_{1}(x):=\det\mathcal{A}_{1}(x)\;,\quad A_{2}(x):=\det\mathcal{A}_{2}(x)\;.$ 
 Assume that the polynomial $A(x)$ does not vanishes identically. Then 
 
 (2.10)  $A{\bf v}=A_{1}{\bf u}\;,\quad AD{\bf v}=A_{2}{\bf u}\;,$ 
 hence ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ are semiclassical functionals related by a rational transformation. Moreover, ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ fulfill the following equations: 
 
 (2.11)  $D(AA_{1}{\bf u})=\big{(}2A^{\prime}A_{1}+AA_{2}\big{)}{\bf u}\;,\quad D(AA_{1}{\bf v})=\big{(}(AA_{1})^{\prime}+AA_{2}\big{)}{\bf v}\;.$ 


By ( 2.3 ) and Leibniz rule, we have 
 
 $\psi(\cdot;n){\bf u}=\sum_{j=0}^{N}\sum_{\ell=0}^{m-k-N}\binom{m-k-N}{\ell}\big{(}\phi(\cdot;n,j)\big{)}^{(m-k-N-\ell)}D^{j+\ell}{\bf v}\;.$ 
 This may be rewritten as 
 
 (2.12)  $\psi(\cdot;n){\bf u}=\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}\varphi(\cdot;n,i)D^{i}{\bf v}\quad(n=0,1,\dots)\;,$ 
 where $\varphi(\cdot;n,i)$ is the polynomial introduced in ( 2.9 ). Taking $n=0,1,\ldots,m-k$ in ( 2.12 ) we obtain a system with $m-k+1$ equations that can be written as 
 
 $\left(\begin{array}[]{c}\psi(x;0){\bf u}\\
\psi(x;1){\bf u}\\
\vdots\\
\psi(x;m-k){\bf u}\end{array}\right)=\mathcal{A}(x)\left(\begin{array}[]{c}{\bf v}\\
D{\bf v}\\
\vdots\\
D^{m-k}{\bf v}\end{array}\right)\;.$ 
 Solving for ${\bf v}$ and $D{\bf v}$ we obtain ( 2.10 ). Finally, ( 2.11 ) follows from ( 2.10 ). ∎

If $m=k$ and $N=0$ , then ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ are still related by a rational transformation, but we cannot ensure that they are semiclassical (see [10] ).

Now, we consider the case $m<k+N$ .

Let $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ be a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,k)$ , so that $(\ref{1b})$ – $(\ref{cond1})$ holds. Let ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ be the regular functionals with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are orthogonal. Assume further that $m<k+N$ . For each $j=0,\ldots,k-m+N$ and $n=0,1,\ldots$ , set 
 
 (2.13)  $\xi(x;n,j):=\binom{k-m+N}{j}\big{(}\psi(x;n)\big{)}^{(k-m+N-j)}\;,$ 
 $\psi(\cdot;n)$ being the polynomial introduced in $(\ref{si})$ . Let $\mathcal{B}(x):=\big{[}b_{i,j}(x)\big{]}_{i,j=0}^{k-m+2N}$ be the polynomial matrix of order $k-m+2N+1$ defined by 
 
 $b_{i,j}(x):=\left\{\begin{array}[]{ccl}\phi(x;i,j)&\mbox{\rm if}&0\leq j\leq N\;,\\[5.0pt]
-\xi(x;i,j-N)&\mbox{\rm if}&N+1\leq j\leq k-m+2N\;,\end{array}\right.$ 
 $\phi(\cdot;i,j)$ being the polynomial given by $(\ref{fi})$ . Let $\mathcal{B}_{1}(x)$ (resp., $\mathcal{B}_{2}(x)$ and $\mathcal{B}_{N+2}(x)$ ) be the matrix obtained by replacing the first (resp., the second and the $(N+2)$ -th) column of $\mathcal{B}(x)$ by $\big{[}\xi(x;0,0),\xi(x;1,0),\cdots,\xi(x;m-k+2N,0)]^{t}$ , and set 
 
 $B(x):=\det\mathcal{B}(x)\;,\quad B_{j}(x):=\det\mathcal{B}_{j}(x)\;,\quad j\in\{1,2,N+2\}\;.$ 
 Assume that the polynomial $B(x)$ does not vanishes identically. Then 
 
 (2.14)  $B{\bf v}=B_{1}{\bf u}\;,\quad BD{\bf v}=B_{2}{\bf u}\;,\quad BD{\bf u}=B_{N+2}{\bf u}\;,$ 
 hence ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ are semiclassical functionals related by a rational transformation. Moreover, ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ fulfill the following equations: 
 
 (2.15)  $D(B{\bf u})=\big{(}B^{\prime}+B_{N+2}\big{)}{\bf u}\;,\quad D(BB_{1}{\bf v})=\big{(}(BB_{1})^{\prime}+BB_{2}\big{)}{\bf v}\;.$ 


By the Leibniz rule, we can rewrite ( 2.3 ) as 
 
 $\sum_{j=0}^{k-m+N}\xi(\cdot;n,j)D^{j}{\bf u}=\sum_{j=0}^{N}\phi(\cdot;n,j)D^{j}{\bf v}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;.$ 
 Taking $n=0,1,\ldots,k-m+2N$ , we obtain the following system of $k-m+2N+1$ equations: 
 
 $\left(\begin{array}[]{c}\xi(x;0,0){\bf u}\\
\xi(x;1,0){\bf u}\\
\vdots\\
\xi(x;k-m+N,0){\bf u}\\
\xi(x;k-m+N+1,0){\bf u}\\
\vdots\\
\xi(x;k-m+2N,0){\bf u}\end{array}\right)=\mathcal{B}(x)\left(\begin{array}[]{c}{\bf v}\\
D{\bf v}\\
\vdots\\[2.5pt]
D^{N}{\bf v}\\
D{\bf u}\\
\vdots\\[2.5pt]
D^{k-m+N}{\bf u}\end{array}\right)\;.$ 
 The theorem follows by solving this system for ${\bf v}$ , $D{\bf v}$ , and $D{\bf u}$ . ∎

In the case $k=0$ we may state a finer result. Recall that if ${\bf u}\in\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ is a semiclassical functional then the class of ${\bf u}$ , denoted by $\mathfrak{s}_{\bf u}$ , is the unique non-negative integer number defined by 
 
 $\mathfrak{s}({\bf u}):=\min_{(\Phi,\Psi)\in\mathcal{A}_{\bf u}}\max\big{\{}\deg\Phi-2,\deg\Psi-1\big{\}}\;,$ 
 where $\mathcal{A}_{\bf u}$ is the set of all pairs of nonzero polynomials $(\Phi,\Psi)$ fulfilling the functional equation $D(\Phi{\bf u})=\Psi{\bf u}$ .

Let $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ be a $\pi_{N}-$ coherent pair with index $M$ and order $(m,0)$ , so that the structure relation 
 
 $\pi_{N}(x)P_{n}^{[m]}(x)=\sum_{j=n-M}^{n+N}c_{n,j}Q_{j}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)$ 
 holds, where $M$ and $N$ are fixed non-negative integer numbers, $\pi_{N}$ is a monic polynomial of degree $N$ , and $c_{n,n-M}\neq 0$ if $n\geq M$ . Assume further that $m\geq 1$ if $N=0$ . Let ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ be the regular functionals with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(Q_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are (respectively) orthogonal. Then ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ are semiclassical functionals related by a rational transformation. More precisely, setting 
 
 (2.16)  $\Phi(x;j):=\frac{\langle{\bf v},Q_{j}^{2}\rangle\psi(x;j)-\sum_{\ell=0}^{j-1}\binom{m}{\ell}Q_{j}^{(\ell)}(x)\Phi(x;\ell)}{j!\binom{m}{j}}\quad(j=0,1,\ldots,m)\;,$ 
 $\psi(\cdot;j)$ being the polynomial introduced in $(\ref{si})$ , then $\deg\Phi(\cdot;0)=M+m$ , $\deg\Phi(\cdot;j)\leq M+m+j$ for each $j=1,\ldots,m$ , and the following holds: 
 
 (2.17)  $\displaystyle D\big{(}\Phi(\cdot;1){\bf u}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;0){\bf u}$ 
 
 (2.18)  $\displaystyle\pi_{N}{\bf v}=\Phi(\cdot;m){\bf u}$ 
 
 (2.19)  $\displaystyle D\big{(}\Phi(\cdot;m)\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\big{(}\Phi(\cdot;m)^{\prime}+\Phi(\cdot;m-1)\big{)}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\;.$ 
 Moreover, $\mathfrak{s}({\bf u})\leq M+m-1$ and $\;\mathfrak{s}({\bf v})\leq N+M+2(m-1)$ .

Since $k=0$ then ${\bf b}_{n}^{[k]}\equiv{\bf b}_{n}^{[0]}={\bf b}_{n}=\langle{\bf v},Q_{n}^{2}\rangle^{-1}Q_{n}{\bf v}$ for each $n=0,1,\ldots$ , hence relation ( 2.6 ) may be rewritten as 
 
 (2.20)  $D^{m}\big{(}Q_{n}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\langle{\bf v},Q_{n}^{2}\rangle\psi(\cdot;n)\textbf{u}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 where $\psi(\cdot;n)$ is defined by ( 2.1 ). Taking $n=0$ , we obtain 
 
 (2.21)  $D^{m}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;0)\textbf{u}\;.$ 
 Taking $n=1$ in ( 2.20 ) and then applying the Leibniz rule, we deduce 
 
 $\langle{\bf v},Q_{1}^{2}\rangle\psi(\cdot;1)\textbf{u}=D^{m}\big{(}Q_{1}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=mD^{m-1}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}+Q_{1}D^{m}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}\;.$ 
 Hence, by ( 2.21 ), we have 
 
 (2.22)  $D^{m-1}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;1)\textbf{u}\;.$ 
 Thus ( 2.17 ) follows from ( 2.21 ) and ( 2.22 ). This proves that ${\bf u}$ is semiclassical of class $\mathfrak{s}({\bf u})\leq M+m-1$ . We conclude pursuing with the described procedure, so that by taking successively $n=0,1,\ldots,m$ in ( 2.20 ), we conclude that the following relations hold: 
 
 (2.23)  $D^{m-j}\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;j)\textbf{u}\quad(j=0,1,\ldots,m)\;.$ 
 In particular, for $j=m$ we obtain ( 2.18 ), hence ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf v}$ are related by a rational transformation. Next, setting $j=m-1$ in ( 2.23 ) we obtain 
 
 (2.24)  $D\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;m-1)\textbf{u}\;.$ 
 Since $D\big{(}\Phi(\cdot;m)\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;m)^{\prime}\pi_{N}{\bf v}+\Phi(\cdot;m)D\big{(}\pi_{N}{\bf v}\big{)}$ , we obtain ( 2.19 ) using ( 2.24 ) and ( 2.18 ). Thus ${\bf v}$ is semiclassical of class $\mathfrak{s}({\bf v})\leq N+M+2m-2$ , and the theorem is proved. ∎

In the case $m=1$ , Theorem 2.3 was partially proved in [12] . Note that the functional equation ( 2.19 ) (for $m=1$ ) was not given therein.

Given complex numbers $\omega$ and $q$ such that $|q-1|+|\omega|\neq 0$ , the operator $D_{q,\omega}:\mathcal{P}\to\mathcal{P}$ considered by Hahn in his influential work [6] is defined by 
 
 (2.25)  $D_{q,\omega}f(x):=\frac{f(qx+\omega)-f(x)}{(q-1)x+\omega}\quad(f\in\mathcal{P})\;.$ 
 The results and proofs in this section can be repeated with almost no changes in the more general setting of the discrete OPS, replacing the derivative operator $D$ by $D_{q,\omega}$ . Actually, the same can be done for discrete OPS on a non-uniform lattice.

3. An application

Let $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ be a monic OPS with respect to a positive Borel measure. Suppose that $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ satisfies the differential-difference equation 
 
 (3.1)  $\pi(x)P^{\prime}_{n}(x)=b_{n}P_{n}(x)+(c_{n}x+d_{n})P_{n-1}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 where $\pi(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $1$ and $(b_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , $(c_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ , and $(d_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ are sequences of real numbers, with $c_{n}\neq 0$ for each $n=1,2,\ldots$ . We assume 
 
 $\pi(x)=x\,.$ 
 OPS characterized by equation ( 3.1 ) have been studied recently in [5] . Here we give an alternative approach based on the general results presented in the previous section. $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ is characterized by a three-term recurrence relation: 
 
 (3.2)  $xP_{n}(x)=P_{n+1}(x)+\beta_{n}P_{n}(x)+\gamma_{n}P_{n-1}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 where $(\beta_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(\gamma_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ are sequences of real numbers such that $\gamma_{n}>0$ for each $n\geq 1$ . We set $P_{-1}(x)=0$ and $\gamma_{0}:=0$ . Using ( 3.2 ), we rewrite ( 3.1 ) as 
 
 (3.3)  $x\,\frac{P_{n+1}^{\prime}(x)}{n+1}=P_{n+1}(x)+r_{n}P_{n}(x)+s_{n}P_{n-1}(x)\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;,$ 
 where 
 
 $r_{n}:=\frac{c_{n+1}\beta_{n}+d_{n+1}}{n+1}\;,\quad s_{n}:=\frac{c_{n+1}\gamma_{n}}{n+1}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;.$ 
 Notice that $s_{n}\neq 0$ for each $n=1,2,\ldots$ . Comparing ( 3.3 ) with ( 1.1 ), we have 
 
 (3.4)  $N=M=m=1\;,\;\;k=0\;,\;\;c_{n,n+1}=1\;,\;\;c_{n,n}=r_{n}\;,\;\;c_{n,n-1}=s_{n}\;.$ 
 Thus $\big{(}(P_{n})_{n\geq 0},(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}\big{)}$ is a $\pi_{1}-$ coherent pair with index $1$ and order $(1,0)$ , where $\pi_{1}(x)=x$ . By Theorem 2.3 , the functional ${\bf u}$ with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ is orthogonal satisfies the relations 
 
 (3.5)  $\displaystyle D\big{(}\Phi(\cdot;1){\bf u}\big{)}=\Phi(\cdot;0){\bf u}$ 
 
 (3.6)  $\displaystyle x{\bf u}=\Phi(\cdot;1){\bf u}\;.$ 
 Since ${\bf u}$ is regular, then ( 3.6 ) implies 
 
 (3.7)  $\Phi(x;1)=x\;.$ 
 On the other hand, by ( 2.16 ) and using the relations $\beta_{n}=\langle{\bf u},xP_{n}^{2}\rangle/\langle{\bf u},P_{n}^{2}\rangle$ and $\gamma_{n+1}=\langle{\bf u},P_{n+1}^{2}\rangle/\langle{\bf u},P_{n}^{2}\rangle$ $(n=0,1,\ldots)$ , we have 
 
 (3.8)  $\Phi(x;0):=-\frac{r_{0}}{\gamma_{1}}P_{1}(x)-\frac{2s_{1}}{\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}}P_{2}(x)\;.$ 
 From ( 3.3 ) for $n=0,1,2$ , and taking into account ( 3.2 ), we deduce 
 
 (3.9)   $\displaystyle r_{0}=\beta_{0}\;,\quad r_{1}=\mbox{$\frac{1}{2}$}\,(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1})\;,\quad r_{2}=\mbox{$\frac{1}{3}$}\,(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}+\beta_{2})\;,$ 
 $\displaystyle s_{1}=\gamma_{1}+\mbox{$\frac{1}{2}$}\,\beta_{0}(\beta_{0}-\beta_{1})\;,\quad\beta_{0}(s_{2}-\gamma_{2})=(\beta_{0}\beta_{1}-\gamma_{1})(r_{2}-\beta_{2})\;,$ 
 $\displaystyle s_{2}=\mbox{$\frac{1}{3}$}\,\big{(}\beta_{0}^{2}+\beta_{1}^{2}-(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1})\beta_{2}+2(\gamma_{1}+\gamma_{2})\big{)}\;.$ 
 Therefore, taking into account ( 3.7 )–( 3.9 ) and ( 3.2 ), ( 3.5 ) reduces to 
 
 (3.10)  $D\big{(}x{\bf u}\big{)}=(-2ax^{2}+bx+c+1){\bf u}\;,$ 
 where 
 
 $\displaystyle a:=\frac{s_{1}}{\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}}=\frac{2\gamma_{1}+(\beta_{0}-\beta_{1})\beta_{0}}{2\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}}\;,$ 
 
 $\displaystyle b:=\frac{\big{(}2\gamma_{1}+(\beta_{0}-\beta_{1})\beta_{0}\big{)}(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1})-\beta_{0}\gamma_{2}}{\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}}\;,$ 
 
 $\displaystyle c:=\frac{\beta_{0}^{2}\gamma_{2}-\big{(}2\gamma_{1}+(\beta_{0}-\beta_{1})\beta_{0}\big{)}(\beta_{0}\beta_{1}-\gamma_{1})}{\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}}-1\;.$ 
 Using ( 3.9 ), and assuming $s_{1}>0$ , we deduce 
 
 (3.11)   $\displaystyle\beta_{0}=r_{0}\;,\quad\beta_{1}=2r_{1}-r_{0}\;,\quad\gamma_{1}=s_{1}-r_{0}(r_{0}-r_{1})\;,$ 
 $\displaystyle\gamma_{2}=\frac{s_{1}(3s_{2}-2s_{1})+2r_{1}\big{(}s_{1}(2r_{0}-r_{1})-r_{0}r_{1}(r_{0}-r_{1})\big{)}}{2s_{1}+r_{0}r_{1}}\;.$ 
 (Notice that $2s_{1}+r_{0}r_{1}\neq 0$ ; indeed, using $\gamma_{1}=s_{1}-r_{0}(r_{0}-r_{1})$ , we have $2s_{1}+r_{0}r_{1}=\gamma_{1}+s_{1}+r_{0}^{2}>0$ .) Thus $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ may be written only in terms of $r_{0}$ , $r_{1}$ , $s_{1}$ , and $s_{2}$ . Hereafter we impose the (integrability) conditions 
 
 (3.12)  $a>0\;,\quad c>-1\;.$ 
 (Note that the condition $a>0$ is equivalent to $s_{1}>0$ in equation ( 3.3 ), or to $c_{2}>0$ in equation equation ( 3.1 ).) Let $w$ be a solution of 
 
 (3.13)  $xw^{\prime}(x)=(-2ax^{2}+bx+c)w(x)\;,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\;.$ 
 Solving this equation imposing (without loss of generality) $w$ to be right-continuous at $x=0$ , we find 
 
 (3.14)  $w(x)=\left\{\begin{array}[]{lcl}K_{1}|x|^{c}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}&\mbox{\rm if}&x<0\;,\\[2.5pt]
K_{2}|x|^{c}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}&\mbox{\rm if}&x\geq 0\;,\end{array}\right.$ 
 $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ being real constants. Requiring, in addition, $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ to be non-negative and no simultaneously equal to zero, $w$ becomes a weight function, i.e., a non-negative and integrable function which does not vanishes identically and having finite moments of all orders. Now, define a functional ${\bf w}$ by 
 
 $\langle{\bf w},f\rangle:=\kappa\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)w(x)\,{\rm d}x\quad(f\in\mathcal{P})\;,$ 
 where $\kappa$ is a normalization constant chosen so that $\langle{\bf w},1\rangle=\langle{\bf u},1\rangle$ . Using ( 3.13 ) and integration by parts, together with the rules of the distributional calculus, we show that $D\big{(}x{\bf w}\big{)}=(-2ax^{2}+bx+c+1){\bf w}$ on $\mathcal{P}^{\prime}$ , hence ${\bf w}$ fulfills the same functional equation ( 3.10 ) as ${\bf u}$ . This is equivalent to saying that the sequences of moments $(u_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(w_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ of ${\bf u}$ and ${\bf w}$ (defined by $u_{n}:=\langle{\bf u},x^{n}\rangle$ and $w_{n}:=\langle{\bf w},x^{n}\rangle$ ) are solutions of the second order linear difference equation 
 
 $-2av_{n+2}+(n+b)v_{n+1}+(c+1)v_{n}=0\quad(n=0,1,\cdots)\;.$ 
 Now we show that we may choose $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ so that ${\bf u}={\bf w}$ . Indeed, since by definition of ${\bf w}$ the condition $u_{0}=w_{0}$ holds, we only need to show that we may choose $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ so that $u_{1}=w_{1}$ . Indeed, 
 
 $\kappa^{-1}w_{1}=\int_{\mathbb{R}}xw(x)\,{\rm d}x=K_{1}\int_{-\infty}^{0}x|x|^{c}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x+K_{2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x\;,$ 
 and making the change of variables $x\mapsto-x$ on the first integral, we obtain 
 
 $w_{1}=\kappa\Big{(}K_{2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x-K_{1}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}-bx}\,{\rm d}x\Big{)}\;.$ 
 On the other hand, from $P_{1}(x)=x-\beta_{0}$ , we have $u_{1}=\beta_{0}u_{0}=r_{0}w_{0}$ , i.e., 
 
 $u_{1}=\kappa r_{0}\Big{(}K_{2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x+K_{1}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c}e^{-ax^{2}-bx}\,{\rm d}x\Big{)}\;.$ 
 Therefore, in order to have $u_{1}=w_{1}$ , we need to impose 
 
 $r_{0}=\frac{K_{2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x-K_{1}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}-bx}\,{\rm d}x}{K_{1}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c}e^{-ax^{2}-bx}\,{\rm d}x+K_{2}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x}\;.$ 
 Assuming without loss of generality that $K_{2}>0$ , and setting $M=K_{1}/K_{2}$ , this is achieved provided that 
 
 (3.15)  $M=\frac{\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x-r_{0}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c}e^{-ax^{2}+bx}\,{\rm d}x}{\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c+1}e^{-ax^{2}-bx}\,{\rm d}x+r_{0}\int_{0}^{+\infty}x^{c}e^{-ax^{2}-bx}\,{\rm d}x}\;.$ 
 Thus, up to a positive constant factor, ${\bf u}$ admits the integral representation 
 
 $\langle{\bf u},f\rangle:=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)w(x)\,{\rm d}x\quad(f\in\mathcal{P})\;.$ 
 We remark that $w$ is a.e. on $\mathbb{R}$ the unique weight function with respect to which $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ is a monic OPS. This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the moment problem associated to the distribution function with weight $w$ is determined, as we may see easily taking into account Riesz uniqueness criterium (see e.g. [4] ). Finally, set 
 
 (3.16)  ${\bf u}^{(M,t,c)}:=h_{\sqrt{a}}{\bf u}\;,\quad t:=b/\sqrt{a}\;,$ 
 meaning that $\langle{\bf u}^{(M,t,c)},x^{n}\rangle:=\langle{\bf u},\big{(}\sqrt{a}\,x\big{)}^{n}\rangle$ for each $n=0,1,\ldots$ . Note that making the change of variables $x\to x/\sqrt{a}$ in the integrals appearing in ( 3.15 ) we obtain 
 
 (3.17)  $M=\frac{\int_{0}^{+\infty}\big{(}x-\sqrt{a}\,r_{0}\big{)}x^{c}e^{-x^{2}+tx}\,{\rm d}x}{\int_{0}^{+\infty}\big{(}x+\sqrt{a}\,r_{0}\big{)}x^{c}e^{-x^{2}-tx}\,{\rm d}x}\;.$ 
 Since ${\bf u}$ fulfils ( 3.10 ) then ${\bf u}^{(M,t,c)}$ satisfies 
 
 $D\big{(}x{\bf u}^{(M,t,c)}\big{)}=(-2x^{2}+tx+c+1){\bf u}^{(M,t,c)}\;.$ 
 Let $(P^{(M,t,c)}_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ be the monic OPS with respect to ${\bf u}^{(M,t,c)}$ . Then ( 3.16 ) implies 
 
 (3.18)  $P_{n}(x):=\frac{1}{(\sqrt{a}\,)^{n}}\,P_{n}^{(M,t,c)}\big{(}\sqrt{a}\,x\big{)}\quad(n=0,1,\ldots)\;.$ 
 Moreover, up to a constant factor, ${\bf u}^{(M,t,c)}$ admits the integral representation 
 
 $\langle{\bf u}^{(M,t,c)},f\rangle:=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(x)w^{(M,t,c)}(x)\,{\rm d}x\quad(f\in\mathcal{P})\;,$ 
 where 
 
 (3.19)  $w^{(M,t,c)}(x):=\frac{a^{c/2}}{K_{2}}w\Big{(}\frac{x}{\sqrt{a}}\Big{)}=\left\{\begin{array}[]{lcl}M|x|^{c}e^{-x^{2}+tx}&\mbox{\rm if}&x<0\;,\\[2.5pt]
|x|^{c}e^{-x^{2}+tx}&\mbox{\rm if}&x\geq 0\;.\end{array}\right.$ 


In conclusion, if $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ is a monic OPS with respect to a positive-definite linear functional and fulfills ( 3.3 ), where $(r_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ and $(s_{n})_{n\geq 1}$ are sequences of real numbers such that $s_{n}\neq 0$ for each $n=1,2,\ldots$ , then $P_{n}$ is given by ( 3.18 ) — $(P^{(M,t,c)}_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ being the unique monic OPS with respect to the weight function $w^{(M,t,c)}$ defined by the right-hand side of ( 3.19 )—, provided that conditions ( 3.12 ) hold for each choice of the four (real) parameters $r_{0}$ , $r_{1}$ , $s_{1}$ , and $s_{2}$ .

For instance, choosing $r_{0}=r_{1}=0$ , $s_{1}=1/2$ , and $s_{2}=1$ , we obtain $a=1$ , $t=c=0$ , and $M=1$ , hence $w^{(1,0,0)}(x)=e^{-x^{2}}$ , so that $(P_{n})_{n\geq 0}$ is the Hermite monic OPS (up to an affine change of the variable). Finally, we note that ( 3.19 ), ( 3.18 ), and ( 3.17 ) agree, respectively, with (2.27), (2.29), and (2.30) in [5] .
